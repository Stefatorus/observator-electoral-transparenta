<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't decisive on its own.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "Elena Lasconi" who is a presidential candidate (Position #1 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (25,000-30,000 impressions) and high spend (300-399 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message "elena lasconi nu are facultate" (Elena Lasconi doesn't have a college degree) appears to be an attempt to discredit the candidate by highlighting a perceived negative aspect about her education. This is clearly meant to influence voters' perception.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't meet journalistic standards. It's a short, unsupported statement without context or balanced reporting.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is not presented as a personal opinion but rather as a factual statement, distributed through paid advertising.

This appears to be negative electoral propaganda because:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- It's distributed widely through paid channels
- It's clearly meant to influence voters negatively
- It's running after the campaign period has ended
- It lacks journalistic value or educational purpose
