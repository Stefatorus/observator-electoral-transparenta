<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, this post mentions "Planul Simion" (referring to George-Nicolae Simion, a presidential candidate) and "Sergiu Mihalcea" (a Senate candidate).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement with an estimated audience size of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: This post has a mixed electoral objective:
- It promotes Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate (which is allowed as parliamentary elections are ongoing)
- It mentions "Planul Simion" which could be interpreted as promoting the presidential candidate Simion, but it's primarily focused on parliamentary elections

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalistic content but rather campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an official campaign message from "Antreprenorii de AUR."

The post primarily focuses on parliamentary elections (promoting Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate) and economic policy. While it mentions "Planul Simion," this appears to be in the context of party policy rather than specifically promoting Simion for president.

While this post does mention George Simion, it does so in the context of party policy and primarily focuses on promoting a Senate candidate. The main electoral message is directed at the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The reference to "Planul Simion" is not explicitly tied to the presidential campaign and could be interpreted as party policy promotion.
