Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, "CMF 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference: The post mentions "Lucian Mija Deputat" and promotes PSD. However, this appears to be for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections.

3. Wide Population Targeting: Yes, it addresses a wide audience:
- High impressions (200,000-250,000)
- Large spend (2500-3000 RON)
- Multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram)
- Estimated audience size of 500,001-1,000,000

4. Electoral Objective: Yes, it explicitly calls for votes ("Votează PSD" and "Votează Lucian Mija Deputat")

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign advertisement, not journalistic content.

6. Personal Opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Brasov.

Important context: This advertisement appears to be for the parliamentary elections (promoting a deputy candidate) rather than the presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign period is still ongoing and allowed.
