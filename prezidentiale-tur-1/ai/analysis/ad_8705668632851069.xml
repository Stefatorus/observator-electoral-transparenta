Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't decisive.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to Elena Lasconi, who is a presidential candidate (Position #1).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (50,000-59,999 impressions) on Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: Yes. The post attempts to mock and diminish Elena Lasconi by comparing her to Viorica Dăncilă, a former politician often criticized for her competence. This comparison is clearly meant to influence voters' perception negatively.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't meet journalistic standards. It's a mockery without any substantive analysis or information.

6. Personal opinion: While it could be argued this is just humor, the fact that it's a paid advertisement with substantial reach and spend (400-499 RON) indicates this is an organized attempt to influence voters, not merely personal expression.
