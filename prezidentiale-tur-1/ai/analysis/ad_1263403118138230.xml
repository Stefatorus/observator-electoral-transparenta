2. Reference to candidate: The post mentions "premierul Marcel Ciolacu" who is also a presidential candidate (Position 3 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1,000,001+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: While the post discusses drug policy, which is an important social issue, it presents Marcel Ciolacu's position and vision in a positive light. However, it presents him primarily in his role as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a policy position statement, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Bucure»ôti) presenting policy positions.

The post primarily focuses on drug policy and treatment approaches, presenting Marcel Ciolacu's position as Prime Minister rather than as a presidential candidate. While it does mention him, the context is within his current governmental role, not his presidential campaign.

The content appears to be more focused on current governance and policy rather than presidential campaign messaging. The presence of a CMF number suggests it's electoral content, but it seems to be aimed at parliamentary elections rather than the presidential race.

</conclusion>

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it appears to be focused on current governance and policy matters, with Marcel Ciolacu mentioned in his capacity as Prime Minister rather than as a presidential candidate. The presence of the CMF number suggests this is electoral content, but likely for parliamentary rather than presidential elections, which would still be allowed during this period.
