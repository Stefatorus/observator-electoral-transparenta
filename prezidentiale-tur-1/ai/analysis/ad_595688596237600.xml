While this post is critical of Marcel Ciolacu, it appears to be legitimate policy criticism rather than electoral propaganda. The focus is on specific legislative actions regarding the Forest Code, with concrete policy implications. The timing during an election period is incidental, and the content would be equally relevant outside of an election period. The criticism is based on actual policy decisions and their environmental impact, not on electoral considerations.
