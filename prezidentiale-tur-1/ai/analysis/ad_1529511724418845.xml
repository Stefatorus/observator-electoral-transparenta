Let's analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't determinative as it's from a news platform.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to "Lasconi" who is ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI, a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message clearly aims to influence voters by stating that Lasconi is not prepared to be president, directly targeting her candidacy.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't appear to be journalistic content. It's a direct statement without any supporting analysis, facts, or balanced reporting that would be expected in journalism.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is not presented as a personal opinion but as a factual statement in a paid advertisement.

The post is particularly concerning because:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- It's a paid advertisement reaching a large audience
- It makes a negative claim about the candidate's capabilities
- It's being promoted after the end of the campaign period
- It has no journalistic value or educational purpose
