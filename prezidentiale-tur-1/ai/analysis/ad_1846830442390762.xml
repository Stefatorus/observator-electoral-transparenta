Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: This promotes Lucian Patrașcu for Senator, but not a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (175,000-199,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is an interesting case because while it is clearly electoral propaganda, it's targeting the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and legal. The post promotes Lucian Patrașcu for Senator, who is not among the presidential candidates listed.

Important distinctions:
- The ad is specifically for parliamentary elections (Senator position)
- The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still active and legal
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential election

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is electoral propaganda, it is LEGAL propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period. The post exclusively promotes a senatorial candidate (Lucian Patrașcu) and makes no reference to the presidential election or any presidential candidates. Therefore, it does not violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004, which specifically addresses presidential election propaganda after its conclusion.
