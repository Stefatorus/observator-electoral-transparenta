<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's specifically for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The content focuses entirely on USR's parliamentary program for diaspora, including specific policy proposals like consular reform, education initiatives, and social assistance. While it contains a CMF number and is clearly promotional, it's legal as it falls under the allowed parliamentary election campaign period.
