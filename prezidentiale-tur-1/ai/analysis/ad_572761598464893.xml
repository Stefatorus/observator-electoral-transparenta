This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections (for a Senate position) which is still in its legal campaign period. The post does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election in any way. While it contains all elements of propaganda (CMF number, call to vote, specific candidate), it's operating within the allowed framework for parliamentary elections.
