While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's focused on parliamentary elections and general party politics, not the presidential election. The post criticizes PSD and promotes PNL as a party, but doesn't mention or attempt to influence the presidential race. The propaganda is legitimate for parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period.
