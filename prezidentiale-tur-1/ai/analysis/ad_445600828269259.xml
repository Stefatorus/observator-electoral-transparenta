Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - CMF 11240017 is present at the end of the post

2. Refers to candidate: While it mentions "campanie parlamentară și prezidențială", it doesn't explicitly name any presidential candidate. However, being from PSD Maramures, this implicitly supports ION-MARCEL CIOLACU.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid Facebook post targeting 100,001-500,000 people, with significant spend (800-899 RON) and impressions (40,000-44,999).

4. Electoral objective: Mixed - While it discusses campaign activities, it's primarily focused on regional party organization and parliamentary campaign activities, which are still allowed. The presidential campaign mention is peripheral.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a party communication, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication about campaign activities.

The post primarily discusses a regional party meeting in Sighetu Marmației, focusing on parliamentary campaign activities. While it mentions the presidential campaign, it does not make specific claims or calls to action regarding the presidential election.

</conclusion>

The content is more organizational and informational in nature rather than attempting to influence presidential voting behavior.
