While this is clearly a political message, it appears to be government/party communication about policy rather than presidential election propaganda. The messaging focuses on industrial policy, energy prices, and economic development. Marcel Ciolacu is mentioned in his governmental capacity rather than as a presidential candidate. The timing and content suggest this is about ongoing governance rather than the presidential campaign.
