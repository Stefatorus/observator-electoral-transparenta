This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not for the presidential elections. The post contains all elements of electoral propaganda (CMF number, call to vote, political message), but since it's targeting a different election whose campaign period is still active and legal, it does not violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004.
