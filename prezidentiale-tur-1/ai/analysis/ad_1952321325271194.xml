3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post from a news outlet, intended to reach a wide audience.

4. Electoral objective: While it discusses the presidential elections, it appears to be more of a news analysis piece discussing PNL's mobilization rather than direct electoral propaganda.

5. Journalism: This appears to be journalistic content. It's presenting an analysis or interview with Remus Pricopie about PNL's mobilization, which falls under normal journalistic coverage of political events.

This appears to be legitimate journalistic content rather than electoral propaganda for several reasons:
- It's published by a news outlet (PS News)
- It features analysis from a political expert (Remus Pricopie)
- It discusses party dynamics rather than promoting specific candidates
- It maintains a journalistic tone and approach
- It doesn't directly advocate for or against any specific presidential candidate
