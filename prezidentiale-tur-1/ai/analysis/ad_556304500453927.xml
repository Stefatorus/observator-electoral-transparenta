Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Guvernul Ciolacu" and promotes PSD's achievements, but it's referring to Ciolacu in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting a large audience (800,000-899,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While the post promotes PSD's achievements, it focuses on specific infrastructure projects (A7 and A8 highways) and their implementation status. The content appears to be more informative about ongoing government projects rather than direct presidential campaign material.

5. Journalism: The post presents factual information about infrastructure projects, though with a clear pro-PSD bias.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official party communication rather than a personal opinion.

The post primarily discusses infrastructure developments under the current government's administration. While it promotes PSD's achievements, it does so in the context of current governmental activities rather than presidential campaign messaging.
