Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present
2. Refers to candidate: Refers to Alexandra Chivu for Deputy position, not a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (300,000-350,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("VoteazÄƒ Alexandra Chivu Deputat")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is indeed electoral propaganda, but importantly, it's for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The post specifically promotes Alexandra Chivu for Deputy ("Deputat") position and PSD for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st. It does not mention or relate to any presidential candidates or the presidential election.

The presence of a CMF number confirms this is official campaign material, but again, for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.
