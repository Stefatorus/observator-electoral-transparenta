Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post refers explicitly to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3). However, the post discusses his actions as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with significant reach (5,000-5,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While the post praises Marcel Ciolacu, it focuses on his achievements as Prime Minister regarding Romania's Schengen accession. However, it does include a comparison with Nicolae Ciucă (another presidential candidate) in a negative light.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content - it's clearly a partisan political communication from PSD Cluj.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication.

The post presents a complex case because:
- It discusses legitimate governmental achievements
- It focuses on Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister
- However, it does include political comparisons that could be seen as electoral messaging

This case requires careful consideration. While the post primarily discusses Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister regarding Schengen accession, the inclusion of a negative comparison with Ciucă-Iohannis could be interpreted as electoral messaging. However, since the main focus is on governmental activity and policy achievements, and the message doesn't explicitly call for electoral support or mention the presidential campaign, it falls within the bounds of acceptable political communication about current governmental activities.
