Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF:11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu directly, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (7,000-7,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: This is complex:
- The post primarily discusses economic policies and PSD's governance program
- While it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as current Prime Minister discussing economic matters
- The content focuses on business policies and economic measures
- There's no direct call to vote or support for presidential candidacy

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a party communication.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication.

However, the key factor here is that this post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections and economic governance, not the presidential campaign. Ciolacu is mentioned in his capacity as Prime Minister discussing economic policy, not as a presidential candidate.

While this is clearly political communication, it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections (which are still in their legal campaign period) and current governance. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in context of his current role as Prime Minister discussing economic policies, not his presidential candidacy. The content is primarily about economic measures and business policies, without any reference to the presidential race.

While this is clearly political content, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it's primarily focused on parliamentary elections and current governance matters, not presidential campaign propaganda. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister discussing economic policies, not as a presidential candidate.
