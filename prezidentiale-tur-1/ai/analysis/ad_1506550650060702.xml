2. Refers to candidate: The post is from Daniel Constantin and discusses PNL vs PSD, but doesn't explicitly mention any presidential candidates from our list.

4. Electoral objective: While the post has political content and criticizes PSD while promoting PNL, it appears to be focused on local/parliamentary politics rather than the presidential election specifically.

5. Journalism: The post links to an interview, but the content and format are clearly campaign-oriented rather than journalistic.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be legitimate parliamentary election propaganda, which is still allowed during this period. The content focuses on local/parliamentary issues in Teleorman, PNL vs PSD dynamics, and regional development. It does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election.
