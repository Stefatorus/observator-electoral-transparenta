Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, it has "Cod AEP: 11240002"

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Nicolae Ciucă, who is a presidential candidate (Position 4), but only in the context of his role as PNL president, not as presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with significant reach (40,000-45,000 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The post explicitly states "Alegerile parlamentare din 1 decembrie" and is promoting a parliamentary candidate named Leontina-Monica Sună.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message for parliamentary elections.

Key observations:
- The post is primarily focused on parliamentary elections
- While Nicolae Ciucă is mentioned, it's in his capacity as PNL president
- The message is clearly electoral in nature but for a different election whose campaign period is still active
- Contains all formal elements of a campaign ad (AEP code, clear party affiliation)

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The mention of Nicolae Ciucă is incidental and in his role as party president, not as presidential candidate. The post is explicitly focused on promoting a parliamentary candidate and the PNL party for the December 1st parliamentary elections, which is legal as that campaign period is ongoing.
