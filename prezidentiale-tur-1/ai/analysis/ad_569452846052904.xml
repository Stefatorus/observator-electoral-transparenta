Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, "CMF11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Reference to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "candidatul PSD Marcel Ciolacu"

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 30,000-35,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to serve multiple purposes:
- Promotes PSD parliamentary candidates in Salonta
- References Marcel Ciolacu's achievements
- Uses campaign hashtag #caleasigurapentruromania

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an organized campaign message with CMF number.

Important context:
- The post promotes both parliamentary elections (which are still in campaign period) and makes reference to Marcel Ciolacu
- While Ciolacu is mentioned, it's in context of his governmental achievements, not explicitly as presidential candidate
- The focus appears to be on parliamentary elections in Salonta
