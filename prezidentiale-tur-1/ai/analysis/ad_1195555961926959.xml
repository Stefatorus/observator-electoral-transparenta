Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240014"

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "George Simion" who is a presidential candidate (Position 2)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting 500,001-1,000,000 people across Facebook and Instagram

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post clearly has an electoral objective:
- Uses campaign rhetoric ("candidatura mea")
- Makes electoral promises ("voi lupta pentru dreptate")
- Associates with a presidential candidate
- Uses political campaign hashtags
- Makes commitment statements typical of electoral campaigns

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message with CMF number and formal political promises

The post is particularly problematic because:
- It's a paid political advertisement
- Contains clear campaign messaging
- Makes electoral promises
- Uses campaign hashtags
- Includes CMF number indicating official campaign material
</analysis>
