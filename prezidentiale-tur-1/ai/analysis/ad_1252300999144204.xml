<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Răzvan Popa" as a Senate candidate, but does not mention any presidential candidates
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (80,000-90,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("Votează Răzvan Popa Senator!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's targeting the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, 2024, not the presidential election. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. The post does not mention or attempt to influence voters regarding any presidential candidates.
