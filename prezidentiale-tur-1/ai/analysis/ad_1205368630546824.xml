2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions).

5. Journalism: The post has elements of citizen journalism, as it informs about a specific policy issue (the Forestry Code) and its implications.

- The post focuses on a specific policy issue (Forestry Code)
- The criticism is directed at current governmental actions
- There's no mention of the presidential elections or Ciolacu's candidacy
- The content is issue-based rather than election-focused
