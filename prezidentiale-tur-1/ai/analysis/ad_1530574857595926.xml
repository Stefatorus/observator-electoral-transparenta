While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically for the parliamentary elections (promoting Ariana Bucur for Deputy) and not for the presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign period is still ongoing and allowed. Therefore, this does not violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004, which specifically concerns presidential election propaganda after the conclusion of the campaign period.
