Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes (CMF: 11240015) - This indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidates: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu and Nicolae Ciucă, both presidential candidates
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 125,000-150,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Mixed - While it primarily focuses on parliamentary elections (explicitly mentioned for December 1st), it also criticizes presidential candidates in their current roles
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political message, not journalistic content
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with CMF number

The post appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in the legal campaign period. While it mentions presidential candidates Ciolacu and Ciucă, it does so in their current governmental roles regarding tax policies, not their presidential candidacies. The call to action at the end specifically references the parliamentary elections on December 1st.
