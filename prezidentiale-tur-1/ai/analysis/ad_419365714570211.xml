Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, this directly refers to Marcel Ciolacu, who is one of the presidential candidates (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions) on Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: While the post appears trivial (asking what Marcel Ciolacu eats for lunch), it's designed to humanize the candidate during the electoral period. However, this alone doesn't necessarily constitute electoral propaganda.

5. Journalism: This does not appear to be journalistic content as it doesn't provide any substantive information or news value.

6. Personal opinion: While informal in nature, this is a paid advertisement by PSD Dolj, not a personal opinion.

The content appears to be a lighthearted post about Marcel Ciolacu, but several factors make this problematic:
- It's a paid post during the restricted period
- It directly names a presidential candidate
- It's sponsored by his party (PSD Dolj)
- Uses hashtag #MarcelCiolacu

This post constitutes electoral propaganda because:
1. It directly references a presidential candidate
2. It's sponsored by his political party
3. It's designed to maintain visibility of the candidate during the restricted period
4. While seemingly innocent, the timing and sponsored nature make it problematic

PSD Dolj, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material publicitar platit pe Facebook si Instagram (ID: 419365714570211) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care face referire directa la candidatul prezidential Marcel Ciolacu. Postarea, desi aparent inofensiva, reprezinta o forma de propaganda electorala prin mentinerea vizibilitatii candidatului in perioada restrictionata, utilizand hashtag-ul #MarcelCiolacu si fiind sponsorizata de catre partidul sau. Efectul electoral este evident prin umanizarea candidatului si mentinerea prezentei sale in spatiul public prin continut platit in perioada in care propaganda electorala este interzisa.
