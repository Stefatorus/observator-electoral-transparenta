<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240022" is present at the end of the post
2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions Alexandru Kocsis-Cristea and promotes Forța Dreptei
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, it explicitly calls for votes on December 1st ("Pe 1 decembrie, votați cu încredere Forța Dreptei!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

The post describes a campaign visit to a market in Făcăi, discussing various social categories and promising solutions for different groups. While most of the content describes the visit and social observations, it concludes with a clear call to vote for Forța Dreptei in the upcoming elections.

However, this appears to be targeting the parliamentary elections (scheduled for December 1st), not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's legal because:
1. It targets the parliamentary elections on December 1st
2. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still active
3. While it promotes Forța Dreptei, it doesn't mention or influence the presidential election
4. The content focuses on local issues and parliamentary campaign promises
