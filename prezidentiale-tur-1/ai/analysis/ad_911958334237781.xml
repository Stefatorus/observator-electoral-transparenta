Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Yes, contains CMF: 11240002, which indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to candidate:
- This post doesn't directly reference any presidential candidates
- It focuses on PNL as a party and parliamentary elections

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 450,000-499,999 impressions
- Targets a large audience (500,001-1,000,000 estimated reach)
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram

4. Electoral objective:
- Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections ("pentru proiectele importante ale Bacăului în Parlament")
- Explicitly calls for voting PNL on December 1st (parliamentary elections date)

5. Journalism:
- No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion:
- No, this is an official party communication with CMF number

The crucial aspect here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.
