While this post does mention presidential elections, its primary focus is on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The references to the presidential election are mainly factual, reporting on Orban's withdrawal, rather than promoting his presidential candidacy. The call to action is specifically for parliamentary elections ("Votați copacul, poziția 6"), which is permitted during this period.
