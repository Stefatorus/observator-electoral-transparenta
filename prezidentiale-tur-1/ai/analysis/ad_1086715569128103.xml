<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, the post ends with "CMF:11240017" which indicates it's electoral propaganda.

2. Candidate reference: The post mentions "premierul Marcel Ciolacu", who is also a presidential candidate (ION-MARCEL CIOLACU). However, the post specifically refers to him in his capacity as Prime Minister and in context of parliamentary elections, not presidential.

3. Wide population targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with an estimated reach of 200,000-250,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections. The post explicitly states "Pentru alegerile parlamentare" at the beginning and focuses on parliamentary candidates and local development projects.

5. Journalism vs Propaganda: This is clearly campaign material, not journalism, as evidenced by the CMF number and promotional nature.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion.

Key mitigating factor: The post explicitly focuses on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. References to Ciolacu are in his capacity as Prime Minister supporting local candidates, not as a presidential candidate.

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it is legitimate parliamentary election campaign material, which is still allowed during this period. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is incidental and in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.
