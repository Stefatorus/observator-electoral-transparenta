Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly mentions George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position #2 on the official list).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (35,000-39,999 impressions) on Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content directly discusses electoral chances in the presidential race, specifically promoting the idea that Simion has "the highest chance to enter the second round."

5. Journalism: While presented on a platform called "PresaLibera.ro", the content appears more promotional than journalistic, as it makes a direct electoral prediction/promotion rather than providing balanced analysis.

6. Personal opinion: While it references someone's opinion (Szakáts István), the way it's presented and promoted suggests it's being used as electoral messaging rather than mere personal opinion.

This post appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It directly references a presidential candidate
- It promotes electoral chances
- It's being actively promoted through paid advertising
- It's clearly intended to influence public opinion about electoral outcomes
