Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240027"
2. Refers to candidate: No, this post specifically mentions only the parliamentary elections
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 6000-7000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but only for parliamentary elections
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is official party communication

Key observations:
- The post explicitly states it's about parliamentary elections ("alegerile parlamentare")
- Mentions position 16 on the ballot
- References December 1st, which is the parliamentary election date
- Does not mention or reference any presidential candidates or the presidential election
- The propaganda is clearly for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period

This appears to be a legitimate parliamentary election campaign advertisement. While it does constitute electoral propaganda, it's specifically for the parliamentary elections where campaigning is still permitted, not for the presidential elections where campaigning has ended.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda but is specifically targeted at the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The post makes no reference to presidential candidates or the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number and clear campaign messaging confirms this is official campaign material, but for a different election where such activity remains legal.
