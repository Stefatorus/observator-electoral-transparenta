Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number present in this post.

2. Reference to Candidates: The post does not specifically name any presidential candidates. It refers to "parlamentarii PNL" (PNL parliamentarians) and is clearly focused on the parliamentary elections.

3. Wide Population Targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting voters in Iași county.

4. Electoral Objective: Yes, but specifically for the parliamentary elections ("Pe #1decembrie, votează candidații PNL!"), not the presidential elections.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content but rather a clear campaign message.

6. Personal Opinion: This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion.

Important context: This appears to be parliamentary election propaganda, which is still allowed as the parliamentary election campaign is ongoing. The post makes no reference to the presidential election or any presidential candidates.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically targeted at the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, 2024. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and therefore allowed. The post makes no mention of presidential candidates or the presidential election, focusing solely on PNL parliamentary candidates and their commitment to local development projects in Iași county.
