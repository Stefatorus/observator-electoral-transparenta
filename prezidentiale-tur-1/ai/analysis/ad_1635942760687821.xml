Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present, but this is from a media organization, not directly from a candidate.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, specifically mentions "Lasconi" (ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI), who is a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (50,000-59,999 impressions) and high spend (400-499 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message clearly has an electoral objective as it discusses voting outcomes and attempts to influence voting behavior by suggesting certain vote outcomes ("Votezi USR iese PNL - Votezi PNL iese PSD").

5. Journalism: While posted by "PresaLibera.ro", this content does not appear to be journalistic in nature. It's a direct message about voting outcomes without any journalistic context, analysis, or reporting.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but rather a targeted message about voting outcomes.

The post appears to be electoral propaganda as it:
- Directly references a presidential candidate
- Attempts to influence voting behavior
- Is widely distributed as a paid advertisement
- Goes beyond journalistic reporting
- Is being distributed during the restricted period
</analysis>
