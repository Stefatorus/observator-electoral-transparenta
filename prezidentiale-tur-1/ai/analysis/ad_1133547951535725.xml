1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF 11240014, indicating this is electoral content

2. Candidate Reference:

- However, the context appears to be about parliamentary elections ("AURÃŽnParlament")
- The post is from Florin-Cornel Popovici, a parliamentary candidate

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- Paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Large reach (10,000-14,999 impressions)
- Clear public messaging

4. Electoral Objective:
- Primarily focused on parliamentary elections
- Mentions support for AUR and George Simion in a party context
- Uses political hashtags and campaign messaging

5. Journalism vs. Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism

While this post contains electoral propaganda elements, it appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of George Simion is in the context of party leadership rather than his presidential candidacy. The post includes a valid CMF number and is clearly marked as political advertising for the parliamentary campaign.

The post does not violate Article 55 t) as it appears to be legitimate parliamentary campaign communication, which is still allowed during this period. The reference to George Simion is incidental and in his party leadership capacity rather than specifically promoting his presidential candidacy.
