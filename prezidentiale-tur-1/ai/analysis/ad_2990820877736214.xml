Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "Cod AEP: 11240002"
2. Refers to candidate: No, it refers to PNL Dolj's parliamentary lists, not to presidential candidates
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, 2024, not for the presidential election. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

Key points:
- The message explicitly mentions "alegerile parlamentare din 1 decembrie"
- No reference to presidential candidates or presidential elections
- Contains proper electoral identification code
- Legitimate parliamentary campaign material during allowed period
