While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is targeted at the parliamentary elections, specifically for a Senate seat in Giurgiu county. The post contains all elements of electoral propaganda (CMF number, clear candidate identification, wide audience targeting, electoral objectives), but it's important to note that this type of propaganda is currently allowed as it's within the parliamentary election campaign period. The post makes no reference to the presidential election or any presidential candidates.
