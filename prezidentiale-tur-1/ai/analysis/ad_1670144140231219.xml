<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: While not naming a specific candidate, it refers to a "university professor" running for Parliament, which is specific enough to identify a candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, specifically targets young people in Buzﾄブ ("Tineri din Buzﾄブ"), and is a paid advertisement with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Alege") and promotes a candidate for Parliament.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (USR Buzﾄブ) with a CMF number.

Important context: While this is electoral propaganda, it specifically targets parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda, as evidenced by:
- Presence of CMF number
- Direct call to action ("Alege")
- Targets specific demographic (youth in Buzﾄブ)
- Promotes specific candidate attributes
However, since it's specifically for parliamentary elections and not presidential elections, it does not violate Article 55 t).
