<analysis>
1. CMF presence: Yes, the post contains "CMF 11240017" which indicates it's electoral material.

2. Candidate reference: The post mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3). However, he is mentioned in his capacity as head of government ("guvernul Marcel Ciolacu"), not as a presidential candidate.

3. Wide population targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching 25,000-30,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: While this is political communication, it appears to be focused on:
- Announcing pension increases
- Promoting governmental achievements
- Supporting parliamentary candidates (Simona Bucura Oprescu for Chamber of Deputies)
It does not appear to be presidential campaign material.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a party communication.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is official party communication.

Key observations:
- The post focuses on pension policy announcements
- While Marcel Ciolacu is mentioned, it's in his role as Prime Minister

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly political communication and electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on:
1. Parliamentary elections (which are still in the legal campaign period)
2. Government policy announcements
3. Promotion of local PSD candidates for parliament

The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his governmental capacity, not as a presidential candidate. Therefore, while this is propaganda, it does not appear to violate Article 55 t) as it's not targeting the presidential election specifically.

<determination>
Based on the analysis, this post does NOT violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004. While it is political communication and contains electoral propaganda elements, these are directed at the parliamentary elections (which are still in the legal campaign period) and government policy announcements. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate, and the post does not attempt to influence voting in the presidential election.
