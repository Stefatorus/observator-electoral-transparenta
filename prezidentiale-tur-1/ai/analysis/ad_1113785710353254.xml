1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3), but in his role as Prime Minister leading the current government, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching between 30,000-35,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: The content appears to be informative about a healthcare infrastructure project rather than electoral propaganda. It focuses on:
- The construction of a new hospital in Oradea
- Technical details about the facility
- Funding through PNRR
- Current governmental activities

5. Journalism: The post has characteristics of institutional communication, presenting facts about a public infrastructure project.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather an institutional communication about a public project.
