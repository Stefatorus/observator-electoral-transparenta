Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Elena Lasconi, who is a presidential candidate. However, the main focus is on a local USR candidate for Parliament.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but primarily for parliamentary elections, which are still in the legal campaign period. The mention of Elena Lasconi as president appears to be incidental and not the main focus of the campaign message.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message for parliamentary elections.

Key considerations:
- The post is primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
- Elena Lasconi is mentioned only once, at the end, as "president"
- The main message and call to action is about sending "a professor from DÄƒneasa to Parliament"
- The content is clearly structured as a parliamentary campaign message

While this post does contain electoral propaganda elements, it primarily targets the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Elena Lasconi is minimal and appears more as a party leadership reference rather than presidential campaign propaganda. The core message, call to action, and entire content structure is focused on the parliamentary candidate.
