<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. <has-cmf>
Yes, the post includes "CMF: 11240014" which indicates it's electoral propaganda material.

2. <refers-to-candidate>
The post mentions "Planul Simion" referring to George Simion, who is a presidential candidate. However, the main focus is on parliamentary elections ("Votați echipa AUR a județului Alba pentru Parlament pe 1 Decembrie").

3. <addresses-the-wide-population>
Yes, it's a paid advertisement targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people) across Facebook and Instagram.

4. <electoral-objective>
The post has a clear electoral objective, but it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is indirect and could be interpreted as referring to his role as party leader rather than presidential candidate.

5. <journalism>
This is clearly not journalism but campaign material.

6. <personal_opinion>
This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication (indicated by CMF number and paid distribution).

Key observation: While this post does mention Simion indirectly, its primary focus and call to action is clearly about the parliamentary elections ("Votați echipa AUR a județului Alba pentru Parlament pe 1 Decembrie"). The reference to "Planul Simion" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as referring to his role as party leader rather than presidential candidate.

<conclusion>
<post_id>581681307663391</post_id>
<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post presents a borderline case. While it mentions Simion's name in "Planul Simion," the context and primary message is clearly focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Simion's plan appears to be in his capacity as party leader rather than as a presidential candidate. The post doesn't explicitly campaign for the presidential election or try to influence the presidential vote.
