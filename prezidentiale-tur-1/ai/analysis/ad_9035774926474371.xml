While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is incidental and in the context of party policy rather than presidential campaigning. The main focus is clearly on Mihai-Viorel Putz's senate candidacy and his educational platform.
