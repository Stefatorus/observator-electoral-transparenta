While this is clearly electoral propaganda (has CMF number, promotes candidates, addresses wide audience), it is specifically targeting parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The content discusses local issues, parliamentary candidates, and community engagement in Maramureș. Since parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed during this period, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
