Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240014"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "George Simion" who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: This is more complex. While it mentions George Simion, the primary focus appears to be on parliamentary elections and local development in Sărmașu, Mureș county. The post is primarily about parliamentary candidacy (Răzvan Biro for Chamber of Deputies) and local development.
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official campaign communication

Key observations:
- The post primarily focuses on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
- While George Simion is mentioned, he's referenced in context of party leadership rather than presidential candidacy
- The message is about local development and parliamentary campaign
- Contains specific promises and critiques of other parties (PNLSD) at local level

While this post does constitute electoral propaganda, it appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of George Simion is incidental and in his capacity as party leader rather than as a presidential candidate. The post's main focus is on local development in Sărmașu and Răzvan Biro's parliamentary candidacy.
