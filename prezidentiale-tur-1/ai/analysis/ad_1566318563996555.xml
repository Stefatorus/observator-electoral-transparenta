3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 45,000-50,000 people

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is a complex case as it mixes parliamentary election campaign (which is still allowed) with promotion of Ludovic Orban, who is a presidential candidate. While the main focus appears to be on parliamentary activities, the inclusion of Orban's governance program during the presidential campaign blackout period makes this problematic.

Pros for violation:
- Mentions presidential candidate Orban
- Promotes his governance program
- Has CMF number
- Is paid advertising

Cons for violation:
- Primary focus is parliamentary campaign
- Orban mention is secondary
- Could be interpreted as party activity rather than presidential campaign
