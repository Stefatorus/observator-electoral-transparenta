Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF number: Not directly visible, but there is a CUI mandatar financiar mentioned (11240017)

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Daniel Georgescu as a candidate for Chamber of Deputies (not presidential)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook advertisement reaching 50,000-60,000 impressions

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections

5. Journalism: It appears to be a political debate show format, which could be considered journalistic content

6. Personal opinion: Not applicable as this is a formal electoral debate announcement

Key observations:
- This is clearly marked as electoral content ("Dezbatere electoralÄƒ")
- It's properly marked with mandatar financiar
- It's focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- The content appears to be a debate show format, which is a legitimate form of electoral communication
