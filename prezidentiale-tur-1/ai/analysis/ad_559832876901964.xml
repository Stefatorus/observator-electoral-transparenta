<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions Viktor Orbán (Hungarian PM) and references RMDSZ (UDMR), but does not directly mention KELEMEN Hunor, who is a presidential candidate. However, UDMR is his party.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (45,000-50,000 impressions) and includes a call to action ("Oszd meg!" meaning "Share it!").

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to be highlighting a diplomatic success (Schengen accession) and UDMR's role in it, but doesn't explicitly call for voting or mention the presidential election.

5. Journalism: This appears to be reporting on a press conference statement, but the call to share makes it more than purely journalistic.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but rather a quoted statement with a call to action.

The post is in Hungarian and essentially says: "Viktor Orbán at his Friday press conference in Budapest: 'I would like to thank RMDSZ for the work they did to help Romania join the Schengen area!' Share it!"

This is a complex case because while it promotes UDMR's achievements, it does so in the context of their governmental work rather than explicitly for the presidential campaign.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this post does promote UDMR's achievements, it appears to be focused on their governmental work regarding Schengen accession rather than explicit presidential campaign messaging. The timing is suspicious, but the content itself discusses legitimate governmental achievements without direct connection to the presidential race.

</conclusion>

The post, while political in nature, appears to be discussing legitimate governmental achievements rather than explicit presidential campaign messaging. The content focuses on international relations and Romania's Schengen accession, which are ongoing political matters separate from the presidential campaign. While the timing might raise questions, the content itself doesn't meet all the criteria for electoral propaganda under Article 55 t).
