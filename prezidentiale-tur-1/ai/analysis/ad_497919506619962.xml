<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is present in the post

2. Candidate Reference:
- The post does not specifically mention any presidential candidate
- It speaks generally about politicians and Parliament

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement with significant reach (70,000-80,000 impressions)
- The message is clearly addressed to a wide audience
- Uses second person ("tu") to address viewers directly

4. Electoral Objective:
- While this is political communication, it appears to be focused on parliamentary activities
- The message is about reducing parliamentary expenses
- It doesn't specifically relate to the presidential elections

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly a political message, not journalism
- However, it appears to be general party messaging rather than presidential campaign propaganda

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion
- It's structured as a party promise about parliamentary reform

The timing of this ad (November 19, 2024) coincides with both the parliamentary and presidential campaigns, but the content is specifically focused on parliamentary activities and reform.
