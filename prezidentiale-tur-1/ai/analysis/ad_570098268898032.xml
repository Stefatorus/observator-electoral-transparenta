This post constitutes electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's focused on parliamentary elections and party policies, not the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number confirms its nature as electoral material, but the content doesn't violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It doesn't promote or attack any presidential candidate
2. It focuses on party policies and parliamentary campaign
3. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
