Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present, but this isn't determinative.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to Nicolae-Ionel Ciucă, who is a presidential candidate (Position 4).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (60,000-70,000 impressions) on Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post appears designed to influence voters by portraying Ciucă negatively, suggesting that even people from his hometown don't trust him. The rhetorical question "Cum să pierzi la tine acasă?" and the statement that "nici vecinii nu-l mai votează" are clearly meant to diminish his credibility as a candidate.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't follow journalistic standards. It's a partisan attack without proper context or balanced reporting.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a paid political advertisement from PSD Dolj, not a personal opinion.

The post is clearly electoral propaganda as it:
- Directly targets a presidential candidate
- Is meant to influence voters' perception negatively
- Is distributed widely through paid channels
- Comes from a political party (PSD Dolj)
- Has a clear electoral objective

PSD Dolj, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin publicarea si promovarea unei reclame platite (ID: 536199915962104) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propaganda electorala negativa la adresa candidatului Nicolae-Ionel Ciucă. Postarea, care a avut un reach de peste 60.000 de afisari si un buget de aproximativ 350 RON, sugereaza in mod explicit ca candidatul nu ar fi demn de incredere, utilizand formulari precum "Cum să pierzi la tine acasă?" si "nici vecinii nu-l mai votează", cu scopul clar de a influenta negativ intentiile de vot ale alegatorilor in perioada in care propaganda electorala este interzisa prin lege.
