<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Yes, contains CMF: 11240014, indicating it's electoral propaganda

2. Reference to Candidates:
- Directly mentions Cătălin Silegeanu as AUR Senate candidate
- References "Planul Simion" (George Simion, presidential candidate)
- However, the main focus appears to be on parliamentary elections, not presidential

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- Paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram
- Significant reach (9,000-9,999 impressions)
- Clearly meant for wide distribution

4. Electoral Objective:
- Discusses AUR's political offer for Romania
- Focus is on parliamentary elections, which are still in the legal campaign period
- While it mentions "Planul Simion," it's in context of party platform rather than presidential campaign

5. Journalism:
- Presented as a journalistic interview
- Conducted by the editor-in-chief
- Follows standard interview format

6. Personal Opinion:
- Not a personal opinion piece, but a structured interview

The key factor here is that while George Simion is mentioned indirectly through "Planul Simion," the primary focus is on the parliamentary elections and the Senate candidate. The presidential campaign connection is peripheral and not the main objective of the content.

While this is electoral propaganda, it primarily targets the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is incidental and presented as part of the party's overall platform rather than specific presidential campaign messaging.

The post does not violate Article 55 t) as its primary focus is parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is not sufficient to constitute presidential campaign propaganda.
