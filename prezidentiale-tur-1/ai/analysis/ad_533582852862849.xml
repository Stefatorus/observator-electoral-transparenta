Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Vlad Popa" as a candidate for Deputy position.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly calls for votes with "Votează PSD" and "Votează Vlad Popa Deputat!"

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with a CMF number.

Important context: This appears to be propaganda for the parliamentary elections (for Deputy position) which is still in the legal campaign period. It does not reference or attempt to influence the presidential election.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's targeting the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. Therefore, this doesn't violate Article 55 t) as it's not related to the presidential elections where the campaign period has ended.

- Has clear electoral messaging

However, it's targeting the parliamentary elections (Deputy position) which is still in its legal campaign period, not the presidential elections.
