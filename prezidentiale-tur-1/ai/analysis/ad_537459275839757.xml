Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post refers to Constantin Fierăscu, who is identified as a USR candidate for Chamber of Deputies, not a presidential candidate. He is not among the list of presidential candidates provided.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with a potential reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The post clearly identifies him as "candidat USR Teleorman pentru Camera Deputaților".

5. Journalism: No, this appears to be a direct quote from the candidate promoting his campaign.

6. Personal opinion: While it contains a personal statement, it's clearly part of a campaign message.

Important considerations:
- This is about parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
- The content does not reference or influence the presidential elections
- The advertising is legitimate for parliamentary candidates during their campaign period
