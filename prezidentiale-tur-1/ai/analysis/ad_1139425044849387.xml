This post presents a complex case. While its primary purpose is parliamentary campaign (which is legal), it includes elements of presidential campaign by expressing support for George Simion. The mention of "Am încredere în planul lui George Simion și în echipa AUR" could be considered indirect presidential propaganda, as Simion is a presidential candidate. However, since the reference is brief and the main focus is clearly on the parliamentary campaign, applying the principle of in dubio pro reo, we should consider this as primarily parliamentary campaign material.

</conclusion>

While this post does mention a presidential candidate, its primary focus is on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of George Simion is incidental and in the context of party leadership rather than his presidential candidacy. Therefore, this does not constitute a clear violation of Article 55 t).
