Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, contains "CMF: 11240014"
2. Candidate reference: Yes, mentions "George Simion" explicitly, who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (25,000-29,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: The post seems to mix parliamentary and presidential messaging
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message

The post requires careful analysis because it contains multiple elements:
- It mentions both parliamentary elections (which are still in campaign period)
- However, it prominently features George Simion, who is also a presidential candidate
- The hashtags and message focus on AUR in Parliament
- There's a significant spend (400-499 RON) and wide reach

This case presents a complex situation. While the primary message appears to be about parliamentary elections ("AURÎnParlament"), it prominently features George Simion, who is a presidential candidate. However, several factors suggest this is primarily parliamentary campaign material:
1. The main message is about exports, imports, and infrastructure
2. The hashtag #AURÎnParlament clearly indicates parliamentary focus
3. The economic message is tied to parliamentary policy
4. Simion is mentioned in his party leader capacity rather than presidential candidate capacity

</conclusion>

The post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions George Simion, it does so in the context of his party leadership and parliamentary campaign rather than his presidential candidacy. Therefore, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
