Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017" which indicates it's electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" multiple times, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching hundreds of thousands of people (200,000-249,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, while it appears to discuss government achievements, it's clearly positioning PSD and Marcel Ciolacu in a positive light, contrasting with their political opponents (PNL).

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a promotional message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with CMF number.

The post is problematic because:
- It's promoting Marcel Ciolacu during the presidential campaign period
- Uses official party channels and CMF number
- Has significant reach through paid promotion
- Clearly aims to influence public opinion about a presidential candidate
