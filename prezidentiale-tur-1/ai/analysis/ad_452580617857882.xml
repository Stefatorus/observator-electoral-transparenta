Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. References to candidate: Yes, it specifically mentions "Lasconi" who is Elena-Valerica Lasconi, a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people and actual impressions between 9,000-9,999.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message appears to be negative campaigning against Lasconi, suggesting she uses "old political sulfur procedures". This is clearly meant to influence public opinion about a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't appear to be journalistic content. It's a brief, negative statement without any substantiating information or journalistic context.

6. Personal opinion: While it includes CTP's opinion (presumably Cristian Tudor Popescu), the fact that it's being promoted as a paid advertisement during the electoral silence period makes it problematic.

The post appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- It's being distributed as paid content to a wide audience
- It has a clear negative electoral message
- It's being promoted after the end of the official campaign period
