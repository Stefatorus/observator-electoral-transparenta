<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present, but this isn't determinative.

2. Reference to Candidate: Yes, mentions "Mircea Geoană" explicitly, who is a presidential candidate (Position 6 - Independent).

3. Addresses Wide Population: 
- This is a paid advertisement
- Targeting 500,001-1,000,000 people
- Spent between 400-499 RON
- Already reached 80,000-89,999 impressions
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram

4. Electoral Objective:
- The post appears to be attempting to create curiosity or potentially controversy about Geoană's family relations
- While it doesn't directly promote or attack his candidacy, it's timing during the electoral period and focus on a presidential candidate's personal life suggests potential electoral motivation

5. Journalism: 
- This doesn't appear to be journalistic content
- It's presented as a clickbait-style question
- Lacks any educational or informative value

6. Personal Opinion:
- This isn't presented as a personal opinion
- It's structured as a provocative question

However, while this post mentions a presidential candidate, it's not clear that it constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It doesn't make any electoral claims
- Doesn't call for any voting action
- Doesn't present any political platform or promises
- Simply asks about a family relation, albeit in a sensationalist way
