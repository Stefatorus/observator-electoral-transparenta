While this post contains electoral propaganda elements (CMF number, political messaging), it appears to be focused on parliamentary/local politics rather than the presidential election. The content discusses local development, minister visits, and regional issues without any connection to the presidential race or candidates. The timing and content suggest this is part of ongoing parliamentary campaign activities, which are still permitted.
