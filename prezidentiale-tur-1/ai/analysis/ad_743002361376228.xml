Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, includes "CMF 11240017" which indicates this is electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: The post does not directly reference any presidential candidates
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post with significant reach (50,000-60,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, which is still in the allowed campaign period
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political attack message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Botoșani)

The post specifically:
- Targets a local PNL leader (Iftime) and questions their business practices
- Makes references to parliamentary elections ("Cum puteți să mergeți acum la acești cetățeni să le cereți votul pentru alegerile parlamentare?")
- Does not mention or influence the presidential election in any way
- Is focused on local political discourse and parliamentary campaign

This appears to be legitimate parliamentary election campaign material, which is still allowed during this period. The post does not violate Article 55 t) as it:
1. Does not continue presidential electoral propaganda
2. Does not attempt to influence voters regarding presidential candidates
3. Explicitly mentions parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
