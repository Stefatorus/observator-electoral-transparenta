Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017" which indicates it's electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to be mixed:
- It discusses general PSD policies regarding young families
- Mentions Marcel Ciolacu as Prime Minister (current role)
- Uses official PSD campaign hashtag "#caleasigurăpentruromânia"
- Is signed with CMF number, indicating it's part of an electoral campaign

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (has CMF number and is paid by "Infomed Pro SRL").

However, the content primarily focuses on parliamentary activities and general party policies rather than the presidential campaign specifically. The mention of Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as presidential candidate.

While this post contains elements of electoral communication (CMF number, party hashtags, etc.), it appears to be focused on parliamentary election campaign, which is still ongoing and allowed. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister discussing government policies, not specifically promoting his presidential candidacy. The content focuses on policy matters regarding young families rather than presidential election messaging.

</conclusion>

In conclusion, while this is clearly electoral content, it appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary campaign which is still ongoing and allowed. The mention of Ciolacu in his PM capacity discussing government policies does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t) regarding presidential election propaganda.
