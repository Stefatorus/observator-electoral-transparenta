While this post contains political messaging and includes a CMF number, its primary focus is on governmental activities and healthcare investments. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate. The post discusses concrete achievements and ongoing projects rather than campaign promises or presidential election matters. Although it promotes PSD's image, it does so through legitimate governmental activities rather than direct electoral messaging.
