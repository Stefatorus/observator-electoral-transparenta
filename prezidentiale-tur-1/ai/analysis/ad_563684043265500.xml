Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, there is an AEP code (CM11240022) which indicates this is electoral material

2. Candidate reference: The post refers to George Ionescu, who is running for Deputy (Parliament), not for President

3. Wide population targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (200,000-250,000 impressions)

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections, not presidential

5. Journalism aspects: This is clearly campaign material, not journalism

6. Personal opinion: This is an official campaign announcement, not a personal opinion

Key observations:

- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- This does not mention or relate to presidential elections
- The spend (1500-1999 RON) and reach indicate this is a significant campaign effort
- The post is purely informative about candidacy for Deputy position

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The post makes no reference to presidential elections or candidates, and therefore does not violate Article 55 t) which specifically addresses presidential election propaganda after the conclusion of that campaign period.
