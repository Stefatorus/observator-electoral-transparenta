Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this is not determinative.

2. Refers to candidate: The post refers to George Simion indirectly through "Planul Simion" and promotes AUR candidates for the Chamber of Deputies. However, it's important to note that while Simion is a presidential candidate, this post primarily focuses on parliamentary candidates.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but primarily for parliamentary elections. The post explicitly calls for votes on three dates: November 24 (presidential), December 1 and 8 (parliamentary).

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an organized campaign message from multiple candidates.

Key considerations:
- The post combines messaging for both parliamentary and presidential elections
- While it mentions "Planul Simion," it's primarily focused on parliamentary candidates
- The timing spans both presidential and parliamentary campaigns

This post presents a complex case as it combines parliamentary and presidential election messaging. While the primary focus is on parliamentary candidates (Burtică Mariana, Snejana Popovici și Alexandra Cruțan), it does reference the presidential election through mentioning November 24 and "Planul Simion". However, since the parliamentary campaign is still ongoing and legal, and the presidential references are minimal and indirect, this could be considered primarily parliamentary campaign material.
