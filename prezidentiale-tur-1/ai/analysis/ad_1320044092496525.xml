1. CMF Number:
- The post contains "CMF: 11240017" which is a clear indicator of electoral propaganda material

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targets an estimated audience of 1,001-5,000 people
- Has already reached 1,000-1,999 impressions

4. Electoral Objective:
- The phrase "CALEA SIGURĂ" suggests a campaign message
- The presence of a CMF number confirms this is campaign material
- The hashtag #ȘOTÂNGA indicates territorial targeting

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It contains an official CMF number
- It's a paid political advertisement
- Uses campaign messaging ("CALEA SIGURĂ")
- Is distributed through official party channels
- Targets a specific geographic area
- Is intended to influence voters

However, since this appears to be related to local or parliamentary elections (targeting Șotânga locality) rather than specifically the presidential election, it may be permissible under current regulations.
