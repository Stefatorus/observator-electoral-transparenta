Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF: 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "CALEA SIGURĂ PENTRU #MĂNEȘTI" (The Safe Way for Mănești), which appears to be about local elections or general party activity, not specifically about any presidential candidate from the provided list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, as this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement with an estimated reach of 2000-2999 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: While it has an electoral message, it appears to be focused on local matters (Mănești) rather than the presidential election.

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalism but a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication (PSD Dâmbovița).

The presence of a CMF number indicates this is electoral propaganda, but it appears to be focused on local matters rather than the presidential election. The timing of the post (November 22, 2024) and its continuation after the presidential campaign period is not problematic if it's not related to the presidential election.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda (evidenced by the CMF number and messaging style), it appears to be focused on local matters in Mănești rather than the presidential election. Since the law specifically prohibits presidential election propaganda after the campaign period, and this post doesn't reference the presidential election or any presidential candidates, it doesn't violate Article 55 t).
