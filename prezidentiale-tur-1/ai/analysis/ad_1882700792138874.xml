<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This case presents several elements of electoral propaganda:
- Direct reference to a presidential candidate
- Promotion of international political support
- Paid distribution to a wide audience
- Timing during the campaign period
- Content that could influence voters' perception positively towards the candidate

However, it can also be argued that this is news reporting about international political relations and party activities. The content appears to be primarily informative about PPE support, rather than direct campaign messaging.

PS News, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material platit pe Facebook (ID 1882700792138874) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaza candidatul Nicolae Ciuca prin evidentierea sprijinului international primit de la familia PPE si Manfred Weber. Materialul, prezentat sub forma de stire, depaseste limitele activitatii jurnalistice obiective, avand ca scop influentarea preferintelor electoratului prin sublinierea sustinerii internationale a candidatului. Efectul electoral este amplificat prin targetarea unui public larg (peste 1 milion de persoane potential expuse) si prin utilizarea unei platforme de social media cu plata pentru promovare.
