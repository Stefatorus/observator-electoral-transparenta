<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240022 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: While the text appears to be from Constantin Stăvărache, it doesn't explicitly reference any presidential candidates.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting a potential audience of 50,001-100,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The content discusses plans for a 4-year mandate and focuses on local/parliamentary issues like entrepreneurship development in Teleorman county.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message outlining political promises and objectives.

6. Personal opinion: While personal views are expressed, this is structured as a campaign platform presentation.

The post appears to be legitimate campaign communication for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. It doesn't mention or attempt to influence the presidential election in any way.
