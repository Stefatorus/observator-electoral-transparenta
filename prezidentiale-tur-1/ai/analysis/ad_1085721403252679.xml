Let me analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: The post doesn't specifically mention any presidential candidate. It promotes PNL as a party, but in a general way.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with significant reach (200,000-249,999 impressions) and substantial spending (4,000-4,499 RON).

4. Electoral objective: While it does have an electoral objective ("VoteazÄƒ PNL"), it appears to be focused on general party support rather than the presidential election specifically. The message "Facem ce trebuie pentru Suceava" suggests local/parliamentary focus.

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalism but rather a political advertisement.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication.

Key considerations:
- The message focuses on local development ("pentru Suceava")
- Uses general party promotional language
- No specific mention of presidential election or candidates
- Could be interpreted as parliamentary election campaign, which is still allowed

While this is clearly political advertising, it appears to be focused on general party promotion and possibly parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The message doesn't specifically reference the presidential election or any presidential candidates. It focuses on local development in Suceava and general party support.
