Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly mentions George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and substantial spending (200-299 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears to be electoral in nature, discussing potential political consequences ("dacă Cirligea câștigă, Simion nu îl va valida") and attempting to influence public opinion.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be from a news page (InfoBraila), the content and tone suggest propaganda rather than objective journalism. It lacks journalistic standards of balanced reporting and appears to be spreading political messaging.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather a coordinated paid advertisement with specific political messaging.

The post presents information about George Simion's actions against another politician (Florin Cârligea), with clear political implications. The timing and nature of the message, being a paid advertisement, suggests this is electoral propaganda.
