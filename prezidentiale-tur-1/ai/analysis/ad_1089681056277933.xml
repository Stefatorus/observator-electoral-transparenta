<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this post does contain political elements and is from a political source (evidenced by the PSD hashtag and CMF number), it appears to be primarily informative about actual policy implementation. The content focuses on specific pension reforms that are already enacted (referencing Law 360/2023) and provides concrete information about changes taking effect in January 2025. The bilingual nature and focus on actual policy implementation suggests this is more of a public service announcement than electoral propaganda.
