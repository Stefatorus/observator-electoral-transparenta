Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, this directly refers to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1,000,001+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: This appears to be attempting to damage Marcel Ciolacu's image by:
- Suggesting improper use of private aviation
- Implying hypocrisy regarding "family values"
- Creating controversy about his relationship with Elena Cocuz
- Using negative terms like "aroganță" (arrogance)

5. Journalism: While presented as news, the tone and timing suggest this goes beyond legitimate journalism:
- Uses inflammatory language ("aroganță")
- Published during election period
- Focuses on personal attacks rather than policy
- Paid promotion suggests propaganda intent

6. Personal Opinion: This is not presented as a personal opinion but as a news story, though with clear negative framing.
