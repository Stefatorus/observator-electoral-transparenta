Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: YES (CMF 11240046)
2. Refers to candidates: YES - mentions multiple presidential candidates (Simion, Ciolacu, Lasconi)
3. Addresses wide population: YES - it's a paid Facebook post with significant reach
4. Electoral objective: Mixed - While it discusses presidential candidates, it's primarily focused on local politics and parliamentary elections
5. Journalism: NO - This is a personal opinion piece
6. Personal opinion: YES - The format is clearly a personal reflection ("Câteva gânduri la ceas de seară!")

The post is complex as it:
- Makes predictions about presidential candidates
- Discusses local politics extensively
- Ends with a call for parliamentary voting
- Contains personal observations and opinions
- Has electoral campaign elements (CMF number)

However, regarding presidential elections specifically:
- The mentions of candidates are predictive in nature
- No direct call to vote for/against any presidential candidate
- Main focus is on local politics and parliamentary elections
- Statements about presidential candidates are presented as personal predictions rather than campaign messaging
