While this post does mention Marcel Ciolacu and includes a CMF number, the context is crucial here. The post primarily discusses his actions as the current Prime Minister regarding Romania's Schengen accession. The content is more informative about government policy than electoral in nature. The timing and content suggest this is legitimate government communication about an important national achievement rather than presidential campaign propaganda.
