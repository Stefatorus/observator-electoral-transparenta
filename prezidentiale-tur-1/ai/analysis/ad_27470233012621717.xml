Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3), but in his capacity as head of government, not as a presidential candidate. Also mentions Alexandru Rafila, who is not a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post on Facebook/Instagram targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: No clear electoral objective for the presidential election. The post discusses a legitimate government activity (hospital construction) and thanks the current government administration. While it mentions Ciolacu, it's in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: The post has elements of public information sharing about a government project.

6. Personal opinion: This appears to be a factual report of an official visit and project update, rather than personal opinion.

Key considerations:
- The post focuses on a legitimate government activity (hospital construction)
- Marcel Ciolacu is mentioned in his official capacity as Prime Minister
- The content is primarily informative about healthcare infrastructure
- While it includes PSD hashtags, these are related to the party's ongoing governmental activity

While this is a promoted post that mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate. The post's primary focus is on healthcare infrastructure development and legitimate government activity. There's no direct call to vote or support for presidential candidacy. The hashtags and messaging are aligned with regular government communication rather than presidential campaign messaging.
