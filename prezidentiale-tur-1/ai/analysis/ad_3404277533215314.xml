While this post does contain electoral propaganda elements, it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Ciolacu appears in context of his current role as Prime Minister and party leader, not specifically as a presidential candidate. The call to action is explicitly for the parliamentary elections ("Pe 1 Decembrie, la alegerile parlamentare, votați pentru soluții eficiente și oameni profesioniști").
