<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "SIMION" and "George Simion" who is candidate #2 on the presidential ballot.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with an estimated reach of over 1 million people and actual impressions between 5,000-6,000.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post explicitly calls for voting ("Votează #SIMION") and promotes a political program.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly not journalistic content but rather a direct call to action for voting.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a paid advertisement with clear electoral messaging.

The post contains several red flags:
- Direct call to vote for a specific presidential candidate
- Promoted (paid) content
- Wide reach
- Clear electoral message
- Continues to run after campaign period ended
