Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240022" which indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, specifically mentions "SIMION" who is a presidential candidate (GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions)

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post discusses electoral matters and specifically talks about Simion entering the second round of elections, which is clearly related to the presidential elections

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a political message with clear electoral implications

6. Personal opinion: While it contains personal opinions, it's clearly structured as electoral messaging, especially given the CMF number and paid distribution

The post is particularly problematic because:
- It discusses presidential election outcomes ("intră Simion în turul doi")
- Contains CMF number indicating electoral propaganda
- Is being actively promoted after the end of the presidential campaign period
- Directly references a presidential candidate's electoral prospects

</analysis>
