1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "George Simion" who is a presidential candidate (Position 2).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with significant reach (4,000-4,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, very clearly. The post explicitly calls for votes on specific dates (24 november, 1 december and 8 december) and promotes AUR and George Simion's "Plan for a righteous Romania."

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't qualify as journalism. While it's formatted as an interview show ("Agora Cetății"), the content is clearly promotional and ends with a direct call to vote.
