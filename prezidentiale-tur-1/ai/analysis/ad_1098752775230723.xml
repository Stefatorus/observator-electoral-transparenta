<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Candidate Reference: The post doesn't directly name any presidential candidate. It only mentions PSD as a party.

3. Wide Population Targeting: 
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people)
- Has received significant impressions (25,000-29,999)
- Clearly meant for mass communication

4. Electoral Objective:
- The message "Ajunge cu minciunile și interesele murdare! Suceava merită mai mult decât PSD" is a political statement
- However, it's not specifically targeting the presidential elections
- Could be interpreted as general political discourse or related to parliamentary elections

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalistic content but rather political communication.

6. Personal Opinion: This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion.

Importantly, while this is political communication, it doesn't specifically target the presidential elections or any presidential candidate. It appears to be more focused on general political discourse or possibly parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly political messaging, it does not constitute presidential electoral propaganda because:
- It doesn't mention any presidential candidate
- Doesn't specifically reference the presidential election
- Could be interpreted as legitimate parliamentary election campaigning
- Is general political criticism of a party, which is allowed

</conclusion>

The post appears to be general political communication or potentially related to the ongoing parliamentary election campaign, rather than presidential election propaganda. Therefore, it does not violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004.
