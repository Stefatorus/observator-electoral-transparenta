<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - CMF 11240017 is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes - The post explicitly mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3), encouraging people to vote for him on November 24.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid Facebook/Instagram post with a significant estimated audience size (100,001-500,000).

4. Electoral objective: Yes - The post explicitly calls for votes ("votează Marcel Ciolacu la alegerile prezidențiale"), making it clear campaign material.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content, as it directly advocates for voting for specific candidates.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is structured campaign messaging with a CMF number, paid distribution, and clear call to action for votes.

The post combines parliamentary election campaigning (which is still allowed) with presidential election campaigning (which is not allowed after the campaign period). The specific call to "vote Marcel Ciolacu on November 24" for presidential elections makes this a clear violation.
