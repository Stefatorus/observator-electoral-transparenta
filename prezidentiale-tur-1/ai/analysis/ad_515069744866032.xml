Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No traditional CMF number, but has a CUI (fiscal identification number)
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions Elena Lasconi, a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (100,000-124,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, discusses voting intentions and support transfer between parties for presidential elections
5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a political statement
6. Personal opinion: While it includes Traian Băsescu's opinion, it's being promoted as paid political content

The post directly discusses the presidential elections by mentioning how votes from Forța Dreptei will transfer to Elena Lasconi. This is clearly electoral messaging continuing after the end of the official campaign period, which violates Article 55 t).

Key problematic elements:
- Explicitly discusses presidential election voting patterns
- Promotes vote transfer to a specific presidential candidate
- Is a paid promotion running after campaign period
- Has significant reach (over 100,000 impressions)

Forta Dreptei, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui mesaj electoral platit pe Facebook (ID: 515069744866032) dupa incheierea campaniei electorale, respectiv dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Postarea contine un mesaj explicit electoral care promoveaza candidatul Elena Lasconi prin intermediul unei declaratii a lui Traian Basescu, mentionand direct transferul de voturi catre aceasta din partea Fortei Dreptei. Efectul electoral este evident prin incercarea de influentare a votantilor prin promovarea unui transfer de voturi, utilizand hashtag-uri specifice alegerilor prezidentiale (#prezidentiale) si avand o audienta estimata de peste 100.000 de persoane. Mesajul reprezinta propaganda electorala conform Art. 36(7) din Legea 334/2006, indeplinind toate criteriile: referire directa la candidat, obiectiv electoral si adresare catre publicul larg.
