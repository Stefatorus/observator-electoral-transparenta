1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not directly name or identify any specific presidential candidate from the current elections. It discusses the presidential elections in general terms.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1M+).

4. Electoral objective: While the post discusses presidential elections, it does so from an academic and analytical perspective. The content appears to be a journalistic piece featuring an interview with a university lecturer discussing institutional trust and historical patterns in Romanian politics.

5. Journalism: This clearly falls under journalistic activity. It's:
- Published by a news platform (Panorama.ro)
- Features expert analysis and commentary
- Takes an analytical, rather than promotional approach
- Discusses broader societal and historical context

The content appears to be legitimate journalistic coverage of electoral topics, which is explicitly allowed during the campaign period. It's an analytical piece that examines voter behavior and institutional trust rather than promoting or opposing any candidate.
