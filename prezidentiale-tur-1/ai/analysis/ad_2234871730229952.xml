Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF:11240015"
2. Refers to candidate: This post does not directly mention any presidential candidate from our list
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 70,000-80,000 impressions
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but appears to be for parliamentary/general party promotion, not presidential elections
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political program presentation
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party platform presentation

The post presents a comprehensive political program covering various social categories (taxpayers, citizens, parents, patients, disabled persons, diaspora, youth, elderly, women). While it is clearly political content, it focuses on general party policies and governance proposals rather than presidential campaign messaging. The presence of a CMF number indicates it's official political advertising, but it appears to be for general party promotion or parliamentary elections, which are still allowed during this period.

Key observations:
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential elections
- Focus on governmental programs and policies
- Uses USR party hashtags (#USR)
- Content is about general governance vision

While this is clearly political advertising, it doesn't appear to be presidential election propaganda. The content focuses on general party policies and parliamentary-level proposals. The presence of a CMF number confirms it's official political advertising, but its content and timing suggest it's aimed at parliamentary elections or general party promotion, which is still permitted during this period.
