Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017" which indicates this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, specifically mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3), though mainly in his role as Prime Minister.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: The post primarily focuses on Romania's Schengen accession and PSD's achievements, particularly highlighting Marcel Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister. While it promotes PSD and Ciolacu, it does so in the context of his current role as Prime Minister rather than specifically as a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a promotional message rather than journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: While expressing support, this is a structured, paid promotional message rather than a spontaneous personal opinion.

Key consideration: The post focuses on Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister regarding Schengen accession, rather than promoting him as a presidential candidate. This makes it fall into the category of allowed communication about official duties.

While this post does promote Marcel Ciolacu and PSD's achievements, it primarily focuses on his current role as Prime Minister and the Schengen accession success. The content doesn't explicitly campaign for the presidential election but rather highlights governmental achievements. The presence of a CMF number suggests it's campaign material, but it appears to be for parliamentary rather than presidential elections.
