<output>
<analysis>
1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240017" is present at the end of the post
2. Refers to candidate: No - The post doesn't specifically mention any presidential candidate from the list
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is clearly addressed to all Giurgiu residents ("giurgiuvenilor")
4. Electoral objective: While this is clearly campaign material, it appears to be for local/parliamentary representation, not for the presidential election
5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a campaign message
6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication

The post appears to be a general campaign message from PSD Giurgiu, focusing on local issues and parliamentary elections. While it contains electoral content (evidenced by the CMF number), it does not specifically reference the presidential election or any presidential candidates. The message discusses local matters (education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and local economy) and is directed at Giurgiu residents.
