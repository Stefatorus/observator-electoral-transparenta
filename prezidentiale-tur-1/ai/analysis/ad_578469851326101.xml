Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF (CMF11240017): Yes, this indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid post reaching 30,000-35,000 impressions
4. Electoral objective: Mixed. While it primarily discusses infrastructure development (A7 highway), it promotes PSD's governance and Marcel Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly promotional content
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

The post focuses on infrastructure developments, specifically the Moldova Highway (A7). While it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate. The message is about regional development and PSD's achievements in government, rather than the presidential election.

Key considerations:
- The content is primarily about infrastructure development
- Reference to Ciolacu is in his PM capacity
- The propaganda appears to be for parliamentary elections, which is still allowed
- No direct call to vote for presidential elections
- Focus is on regional development and party achievements
