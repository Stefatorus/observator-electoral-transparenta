Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes (CMF: 11240017) - This indicates it's an electoral message
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 3000-3999 people
4. Electoral objective: This is tricky. While it discusses Ciolacu's activity as Prime Minister regarding Schengen, it also promotes his image during the electoral period
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a promotional message from PSD Dolj
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

The post discusses Romania's Schengen accession and presents it as a victory of "Guvernul Ciolacu." While this is related to his current role as Prime Minister, the timing and promotion during the electoral period, combined with the CMF number and party branding (#PSD) suggests this is part of a broader electoral strategy.

However, the content itself focuses on actual governmental achievements and doesn't explicitly call for votes or make direct references to the presidential election. It can be argued this falls under legitimate communication about governmental activities.

While this post contains elements of electoral communication (CMF number, party branding), its primary focus is on actual governmental achievements regarding Schengen accession. The content can be justified as legitimate governmental communication about an important national achievement, rather than explicit presidential campaign propaganda.
