<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - CMF 11240002 is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes - The post explicitly mentions "Nicolae Ciucă" who is a presidential candidate (Position 4).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting a significant audience (1001-5000 people).

4. Electoral objective: Mixed/Complex case:
- The post primarily focuses on parliamentary elections (which are still in the allowed campaign period)
- However, it specifically mentions Nicolae Ciucă as President ("Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte"), which crosses into presidential election territory
- Promotes PNL's vision and calls for votes for PNL

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with CMF number.

The post presents a complex situation because while it mainly focuses on parliamentary elections (which would be allowed), it specifically promotes Nicolae Ciucă as President, which makes it problematic given the presidential campaign period has ended.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It contains a CMF number
- It explicitly promotes a presidential candidate (Nicolae Ciucă)
- It's a paid advertisement reaching a wide audience
- It combines parliamentary campaign (allowed) with presidential campaign elements (not allowed)
- It explicitly calls for votes
The mention of "Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte" makes this post problematic as it continues presidential electoral propaganda after the campaign period has ended.

Partidul Național Liberal (PNL), prin intermediul paginii "Ucu Dima", pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unei reclame platite pe Facebook (ID: 546432674845737) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care continua propaganda electorala pentru candidatul la presedintie Nicolae Ciucă. Postarea, care include numarul CMF 11240002, promoveaza explicit candidatul la presedintie prin mentiunea "Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte", constituind astfel continuarea propagandei electorale pentru alegerile prezidentiale dupa incheierea campaniei. Efectul electoral al acestei comunicari este evident prin asocierea directa a candidatului cu functia de Presedinte si prin indemnul explicit la vot, incalcand astfel prevederile legale privind perioada de campanie electorala pentru alegerile prezidentiale.
