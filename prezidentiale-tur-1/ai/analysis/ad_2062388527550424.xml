Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly mentions George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, with an estimated reach of 80,000-89,999 impressions and a significant spend of 200-299 RON.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post clearly has an electoral objective as it discusses chances of success in the presidential elections, specifically mentioning "turul al doilea la prezidențiale" (second round of presidential elections).

5. Journalism: While presented as "PresaLibera.ro", this doesn't appear to be objective journalism but rather promotional content about electoral chances.

6. Personal opinion: While it presents someone's (Szakáts István) opinion, it's being promoted as paid content specifically about electoral chances.

This appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It directly references a presidential candidate
- It discusses electoral chances in the presidential race
- It's being actively promoted through paid advertising
- It's clearly intended to influence public opinion about electoral outcomes
- The timing (after November 22) is during the period when presidential election propaganda is prohibited

PresaLibera.ro, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin publicarea și promovarea activă a unui material de propagandă electorală după încheierea perioadei de campanie, referitor la șansele candidatului George Simion în alegerile prezidențiale. Materialul, cu ID-ul 2062388527550424, publicat și promovat după ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, reprezintă o încălcare clară a legii prin faptul că discută explicit despre șansele electorale ale unui candidat la președinție într-un context care vizează influențarea opiniei publice, având un caracter propagandistic evident prin promovarea plătită pe platformele Facebook și Instagram, cu o audiență estimată între 80.000 și 89.999 de impresii.
