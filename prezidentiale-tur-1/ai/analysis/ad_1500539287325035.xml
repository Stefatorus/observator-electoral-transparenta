Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes (CMF: 11240017) - This indicates it's electoral content
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 8,000-8,999 people
4. Electoral objective: This is debatable:
   - The post focuses on infrastructure achievements
   - It mentions Marcel Ciolacu in his capacity as Prime Minister
   - The context is about historical PSD governance achievements
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a promotional message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

The post primarily discusses the BrÄƒila-Tulcea bridge construction, focusing on PSD's role in its development across different administrations. While it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister in relation to the bridge's inauguration, not as a presidential candidate. The post appears to be about party achievements rather than presidential campaign messaging.

</conclusion>

The post appears to be legitimate party communication about governance achievements rather than presidential campaign propaganda. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, and the focus is on infrastructure development. While it contains a CMF number, the content itself doesn't appear to violate Article 55 t) as it's not specifically targeting the presidential election or attempting to influence voters' presidential choices.
