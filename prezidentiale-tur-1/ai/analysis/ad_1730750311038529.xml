Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidates: Yes, specifically mentions Nicolae Ciucă and George Simion, who are both presidential candidates.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook with potential reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: The content presents polling information about presidential candidates' chances for the second round. While it appears to be news coverage, promoting such content through paid advertising during the propaganda blackout period could be considered as having an electoral objective.

5. Journalism: While the content appears to be news coverage of a poll, the fact that it's being promoted through paid advertising after the campaign period raises concerns. Normal journalistic coverage wouldn't typically require paid promotion during this sensitive period.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather a presentation of polling data.

The post discusses polling results specifically related to the presidential election, comparing two candidates' chances for the second round. Given that this is a paid promotion running after the campaign period has ended (November 22), this could be considered a violation of Article 55 t).

Materialul platit promoveaza un sondaj electoral care prezinta sansele candidatilor Nicolae Ciucă si George Simion pentru turul doi al alegerilor prezidentiale, avand un efect electoral direct prin informarea si potentiala influentare a votantilor cu privire la optiunile electorale. Postarea cu ID-ul 1730750311038529 reprezinta propaganda electorala prin natura sa, fiind promovata prin publicitate platita pe Facebook, cu un reach estimat de peste 1 milion de persoane, depasind astfel limitele unei simple informari jurnalistice.
