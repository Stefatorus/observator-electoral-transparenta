While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The post discusses local issues in Teleorman, features a parliamentary candidate, and makes no mention of presidential candidates or the presidential race. The presence of a CMF number confirms this is official campaign material, but for a different election whose campaign period is still ongoing and legal.

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it is campaign material for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The content has no connection to the presidential election and therefore does not constitute illegal post-campaign presidential election propaganda.
