Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF, but has CUI (which is different), showing it's from a political party
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly references Elena Lasconi, a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (70,000-80,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, clearly shows support for a presidential candidate through an influential political figure
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political message of support
6. Personal opinion: While it includes BÄƒsescu's opinion, it's being used in a paid political advertisement to influence voters

The post is particularly problematic because:
- It directly promotes Elena Lasconi for the presidential election
- It's being run after the campaign period has ended
- It's a paid advertisement with significant reach
- It uses a former president's endorsement to influence voters
