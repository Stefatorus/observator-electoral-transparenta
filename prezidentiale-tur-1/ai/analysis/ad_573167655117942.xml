<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Simion" and "Sergiu Mihalcea". While George Simion is a presidential candidate, this post appears to be primarily focused on Sergiu Mihalcea's Senate candidacy for Ilfov.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1M+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for the parliamentary elections ("VoteazÄƒ Sergiu Mihalcea, candidat AUR la Senat Ilfov"), not the presidential election. The mention of "Planul Simion" appears to be in context of party leadership rather than the presidential campaign.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication.

The post focuses on parliamentary elections (Senate seat for Ilfov) which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions Simion, it does so in the context of a party plan/platform rather than explicitly promoting him for president.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it primarily targets the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Simion is indirect and in the context of party policy rather than his presidential candidacy. The main call to action is to vote for Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate.
