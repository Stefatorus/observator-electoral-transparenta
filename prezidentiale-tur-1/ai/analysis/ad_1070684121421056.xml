Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is present, which suggests this might not be direct electoral propaganda.

2. Reference to Candidates:
- The post mentions "candida»õii REPER" generically but doesn't specifically name any presidential candidates.
- It appears to be about party activity rather than specific presidential candidates.

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targets a significant audience (100,001-500,000 people)
- High impression count (15,000-19,999)

4. Electoral Objective:
- While this is political in nature, it appears to be about general party visibility
- The timing is suspicious (during the presidential election period)
- However, it focuses on party activities and general political engagement
- Does not specifically mention presidential elections or candidates

5. Journalism/Personal Opinion:
- This is clearly a party communication, not journalism
- It's an organizational/mobilization message

The post appears to be walking a fine line. While it's political in nature, it doesn't explicitly engage in presidential election propaganda. It's focused on party activities and general political engagement, without specific references to the presidential race.

This case requires careful consideration. While the post is political in nature, several factors suggest it may not constitute electoral propaganda for the presidential election:

Pros for violation:
- Timing during election period
- Paid political advertisement
- References to voting day

Cons for violation:
- No specific presidential candidates mentioned
- Focuses on general party activity
- No explicit call to vote for/against any presidential candidate
- Could be interpreted as parliamentary election activity, which is still allowed
