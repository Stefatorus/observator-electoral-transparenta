<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Guvernul Ciolacu" and references Ion-Marcel Ciolacu indirectly, who is a presidential candidate. However, the reference is made to his current role as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post targeting pensioners in Cluj county, reaching between 6,000-7,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: While this is a political message, it focuses on current governmental actions regarding pension recalculation. The message appears to be more informative about current government activities rather than specifically promoting Ciolacu as a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content but rather a political announcement.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official communication about government actions, not a personal opinion.

The key factor here is that while Ciolacu is mentioned, he's referenced in his capacity as Prime Minister regarding current government activities, not as a presidential candidate. The post focuses on actual administrative actions (pension recalculation) rather than campaign promises or electoral messaging for the presidential election.

While this is clearly a political message, it doesn't constitute electoral propaganda for the presidential elections because:
1. It focuses on current governmental activities
2. Mentions Ciolacu in his PM capacity, not as a candidate
3. Discusses concrete administrative actions already in progress
4. Doesn't make any references to the presidential election or campaign promises
