While this is clearly electoral content (evidenced by the CMF number), the message appears to be focused on local/parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election. The content is vague and doesn't specifically mention or promote any presidential candidate. The phrase "CALEA SIGURĂ PENTRU #PRODULEȘTI" appears to be focused on local issues or parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.
