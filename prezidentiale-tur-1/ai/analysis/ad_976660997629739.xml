<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this post contains a CMF number and is from a political party (PSD), its content is focused on legitimate governmental communication about infrastructure developments. It doesn't mention presidential elections or candidates, nor does it attempt to influence voting behavior for the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number alone doesn't automatically make it electoral propaganda for the presidential election, as there are ongoing parliamentary election campaigns where such numbers are required.
