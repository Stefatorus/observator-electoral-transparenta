<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not specifically mention any presidential candidate by name. It only mentions PNL as a party.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Instagram targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people) in Suceava.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, it has a clear electoral objective with the direct call to "Votează PNL pe buletinul de vot!" However, this appears to be focused on general party support rather than the presidential election specifically.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PNL Suceava.

The key point here is that while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be general party messaging or potentially related to parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. It does not specifically mention or promote Nicolae-Ionel Ciucă or any other presidential candidate.
