Let's analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, CMF:11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Reference to candidates:
- Mentions "Lasconi" who is a presidential candidate (ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI)
- However, this appears in a hashtag context alongside parliamentary candidates
- The main message is focused on USR as a party and parliamentary elections

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (40,000-45,000 impressions)
- Uses general call to action "Votați USR!"
- Targets a broad audience (100,001-500,000 estimated audience)

4. Electoral objective:
- Yes, but primarily for parliamentary elections
- The message "Votați USR!" is clearly electoral
- The context is about systemic change and party support, not specifically presidential

5. Journalism/Personal Opinion:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- It's a direct political advertisement with party messaging

The key factor here is that while Lasconi is mentioned, she appears only in hashtags alongside other candidates and party references. The primary focus is on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Lasconi is incidental and appears only in hashtags, not as the main focus of the message. The overall context and message is about party support and parliamentary elections, not the presidential race.
