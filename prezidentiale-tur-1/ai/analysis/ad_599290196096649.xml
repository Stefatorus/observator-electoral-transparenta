Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3), though in his capacity as Prime Minister

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (15,000-20,000 impressions)

4. Electoral objective: The post promotes PSD's achievements, specifically the bridge between Tulcea and Brăila, attributing success to three PSD governments. The final line "PSD este calea sigură pentru România!" is clearly campaign messaging

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather promotional material highlighting party achievements

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with clear promotional intent

However, the post primarily focuses on:
- Historical infrastructure achievement (the bridge)
- Past governmental accomplishments
- Marcel Ciolacu is mentioned in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as presidential candidate
- The message is more about PSD's general competence than the presidential race specifically

While this is clearly political advertising, it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections rather than the presidential race specifically.

This post constitutes electoral propaganda but appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister regarding a specific infrastructure project, not as a presidential candidate. The content focuses on PSD's governmental achievements rather than presidential candidacy.
