Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240017 PSD GIURGIU SENAT" - This indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Mentions "PIEDONE" multiple times, though not specifically for presidential elections
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook post targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections (mentions SENAT)
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Giurgiu)

Key observations:
- The post is critical of PNL and their governance
- It mentions Piedone, but in context of Giurgiu, not presidential elections
- The CMF number specifically mentions SENAT, indicating this is for parliamentary elections
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- While aggressive in tone, it doesn't specifically advocate for or against any presidential candidate

Important context: While Piedone is mentioned, this appears to be about his activity in Giurgiu and parliamentary elections, not the presidential race. The post focuses on local issues and parliamentary campaign themes.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is indeed electoral propaganda, but for parliamentary elections (SENAT) which is currently allowed. The post discusses local issues in Giurgiu and criticizes PNL's governance, but does not make any claims or appeals related to the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number for SENAT confirms this is parliamentary campaign material.
