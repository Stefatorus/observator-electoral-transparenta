<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240014" is present
2. Refers to candidate: Yes - mentions "PlanulSimion" which refers to George Simion, a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post with broad reach
4. Electoral objective: This appears to be focused on parliamentary reforms and governance, not specifically the presidential election. The message discusses AUR's plans for parliamentary and government reform, including reducing the number of parliamentarians and ministries.
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political communication
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party position

The post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary reforms and future governance plans, which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions "PlanulSimion", the content itself discusses parliamentary and governmental reforms rather than presidential campaign matters.

The presence of a CMF number indicates this is campaign material, but it appears to be directed at the parliamentary campaign, which is still ongoing and legal, rather than the presidential campaign.
