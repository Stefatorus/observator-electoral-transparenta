Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to Elena Lasconi, who is a presidential candidate (Position #1).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, with an estimated reach of 25,000-30,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears designed to mock and criticize a presidential candidate's foreign policy stance, potentially influencing voters' perception.

5. Journalism: While it quotes journalist Ion Cristoiu, the way the quote is used appears more propagandistic than journalistic, lacking context or balanced reporting.

6. Personal opinion: While it presents Cristoiu's opinion, the way it's promoted as a paid ad during the electoral period suggests a coordinated effort to influence public opinion.

The post goes beyond simple journalism or opinion by:
- Targeting a specific presidential candidate
- Using mockery to diminish the candidate's credibility
- Being promoted as paid content during the electoral period
- Focusing on criticism without providing balanced context
