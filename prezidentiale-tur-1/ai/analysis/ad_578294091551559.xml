<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Presence:
- Yes, contains "CMF: 11240015" which indicates this is electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- While it doesn't directly name a presidential candidate, it's asking "Pe cine votezi sa te reprezinte?"
- However, this appears to be related to local/parliamentary representation, not presidential elections

3. Wide Population Address:
- Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching 7,000-7,999 impressions
- Targets a specific region (Caraș-Severin)
- Estimated audience size of 100,001-500,000

4. Electoral Objective:
- Yes, but appears to be for parliamentary/local elections
- Uses electoral messaging ("Pe cine votezi sa te reprezinte?")
- Promotes USR as "o voce pentru Caraș-Severin"

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Contains campaign messaging and party promotion

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication (USR Caraș-Severin)

The key point here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it appears to be targeting parliamentary/local representation rather than the presidential election. The message focuses on local representation in Caraș-Severin and doesn't mention any presidential candidates.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is electoral propaganda, but it appears to be legitimate as it:
1. Focuses on parliamentary/local representation
2. Doesn't mention presidential candidates
3. Is geographically focused on Caraș-Severin
4. Uses proper electoral marketing identification (CMF number)
The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing, making this legal.
