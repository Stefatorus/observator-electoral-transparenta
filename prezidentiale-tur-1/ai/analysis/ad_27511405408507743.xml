Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - CMF 11240022 is present, indicating this is electoral material.

2. Refers to candidate: While this post mentions Forța Dreptei, it's specifically about parliamentary elections, not presidential ones. Ludovic Orban, while a presidential candidate, is not mentioned directly.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - this is a paid advertisement targeting a large audience (45,000-50,000 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes - it explicitly calls for votes for Forța Dreptei in the parliamentary elections ("Pe 1 Decembrie votezi Forța Dreptei pentru Parlamentul României!")

5. Journalism: No - this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - this is official party communication with a CMF number.

Important context: This advertisement is specifically focused on parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.
