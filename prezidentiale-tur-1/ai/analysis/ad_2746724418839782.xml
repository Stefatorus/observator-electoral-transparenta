<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240017" is present at the end, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: This post promotes Marga Pîrvănoiu, who is not on the presidential candidates list. The post appears to be promoting her as a parliamentary candidate for PSD Maramureș.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - this is a paid advertisement reaching 70,000-80,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Yes - this is clearly promoting a parliamentary candidate, but importantly, not for the presidential election.

5. Journalism: No - this is clearly a promotional piece praising the candidate's qualities and experience.

6. Personal opinion: While written in a personal tone by Dancus Ioan Doru, this is clearly a structured campaign message.

Key considerations:
- This is explicitly for parliamentary elections, not presidential
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- Contains no references to presidential candidates or the presidential election
- Uses appropriate CMF number for parliamentary campaign

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is legal and appropriate because:
1. It exclusively promotes a parliamentary candidate
2. It does not mention or influence the presidential election
3. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed
4. It properly uses campaign marketing elements (CMF number)
