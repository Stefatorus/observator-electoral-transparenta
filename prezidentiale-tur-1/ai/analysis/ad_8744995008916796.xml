Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present, but this is from a news platform, not directly from a candidate.

- High spend (600-699 RON)
- Clearly meant for mass consumption

4. Electoral Objective:

- Announces support for another candidate (Simion)
- Clear attempt to influence voter perception
- Presents one candidate positively (Simion) while implying negative impact for another (Lasconi)

5. Journalism:
- While presented on a news platform, this goes beyond objective reporting

- Has significant reach and investment in distribution
- The timing and content suggest intent to influence voter preference

Comentatorii.RO, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material de propaganda electorala pentru alegerile prezidentiale dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie, respectiv dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Materialul, cu ID-ul 8744995008916796 pe Facebook, prezinta explicit sustinerea unui candidat prezidential (George Simion) in detrimentul altui candidat (Elena Lasconi), folosind resurse financiare pentru promovare (600-699 RON) si obtinand un impact semnificativ (300,000-350,000 impresii). Continutul depaseste limitele activitatii jurnalistice obiective, prezentand explicit sustinerea unui candidat si respingerea altuia, cu scopul clar de a influenta preferintele electorale ale publicului larg.
