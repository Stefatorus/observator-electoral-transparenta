Let's analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240002 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Nicolae Ciucă explicitly, who is a presidential candidate (Position 4). However, it's worth noting that this post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections and PNL's broader vision.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a broad audience.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but primarily for parliamentary elections. However, by mentioning "Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte," it also promotes his presidential candidacy.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with a CMF number.

Key concerning elements:
- The post explicitly states "Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte"
- Contains a CMF number
- Is being promoted after the end of the presidential campaign period
- Combines parliamentary and presidential messaging

While most of the content focuses on parliamentary elections (which is still allowed), the inclusion of Nicolae Ciucă as president makes this problematic under Article 55 t) as it continues presidential electoral propaganda after the conclusion of the campaign period.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda for both parliamentary and presidential elections. While parliamentary election propaganda is still permitted, the inclusion of presidential campaign messaging ("Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte") after the campaign period makes this post problematic. The presence of a CMF number, direct candidate reference, and clear electoral objectives confirm its propaganda nature.

Partidul Național Liberal, prin intermediul paginii "Ucu Dima", pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unui material de propaganda electorala pentru alegerile prezidentiale (ID postare Facebook: 445998178606699) dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie electorala (dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024). Materialul promovat include in mod explicit mesajul "Cu Nicolae Ciucă Președinte", promovand astfel candidatura sa la functia de presedinte al Romaniei, avand un evident caracter de propaganda electorala pentru alegerile prezidentiale, fapt demonstrat si prin prezenta codului unic CMF 11240002. Efectul electoral urmarit este influentarea intentiei de vot a alegatorilor in favoarea candidatului Nicolae Ciucă la functia de presedinte, prin asocierea acestuia cu un program de guvernare si promisiuni electorale.
