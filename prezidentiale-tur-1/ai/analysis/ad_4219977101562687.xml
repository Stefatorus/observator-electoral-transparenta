While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be targeting the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The content focuses on PSD's governance program and local healthcare initiatives, without any mention of presidential candidates or the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number confirms its nature as campaign material, but for a different election than the presidential one.
