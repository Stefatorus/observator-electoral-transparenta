<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this post contains electoral elements (CMF number, party branding), it appears to be focused on local/parliamentary messaging rather than presidential elections. The content is generic and doesn't reference any presidential candidate or the presidential race. The presence of a CMF number indicates this is electoral content, but likely for the concurrent parliamentary elections where propaganda is still permitted.

Key factors:
- No mention of presidential candidates
- Generic message about local identity
- Focus on Constanța and Hârșova
- Lacks specific presidential election context
