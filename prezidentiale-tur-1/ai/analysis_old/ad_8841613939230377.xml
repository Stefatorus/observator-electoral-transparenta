Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3). However, the mention appears to be incidental, as part of a news report about Roxana Mînzatu's validation as Vice President of the European Commission.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, as this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated audience size over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: No clear electoral objective is apparent. The content appears to be primarily informative about EU politics and Romania's representation in the European Commission.

5. Journalism: Yes, this appears to be sharing news content from antena3.ro, following journalistic standards. The content is focused on reporting a factual event regarding EU politics.

6. Personal opinion: No personal opinions are expressed; the content is presented as straight news reporting.

The post appears to be primarily focused on sharing news about Roxana Mînzatu's appointment, with Marcel Ciolacu mentioned only in passing as the source of the information in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

This does not appear to be electoral propaganda for several reasons:
- The primary focus is on EU politics news
- Marcel Ciolacu is mentioned in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate
- The content is journalistic in nature
- There is no clear electoral message or call to action
- The timing and context suggest this is regular news reporting
