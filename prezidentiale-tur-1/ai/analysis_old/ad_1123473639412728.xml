<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present in this post, though not mandatory for all communications.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "Simion" who is GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION, a registered presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of over 1 million people, specifically in Botoșani area.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this clearly has an electoral objective:
- Uses hashtags #VoteazăAUR
- Promotes "Planul Simion"
- Is explicitly political in nature
- Is clearly trying to influence voters

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's a direct campaign message promoting a candidate and their plan.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official paid advertisement from a party-affiliated page "Alegerea de AUR".

The timing of this advertisement (after November 20, 2024) and its continuation past the electoral propaganda period for presidential elections makes it problematic.
