- It promotes PNL as a party for parliamentary elections

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (450,000-499,999 impressions)
- Targets a wide audience in Bacău region

4. Electoral objective:
- Yes, explicitly calls for votes: "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează PNL!"
