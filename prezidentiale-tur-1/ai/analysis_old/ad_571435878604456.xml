Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240015" is present at the end of the post
2. Refers to candidate: Yes - Mentions "Ciolacu" (ION-MARCEL CIOLACU), who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement with significant reach (100,000-124,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes - Explicitly calls for electoral action ("Pe 1 decembrie avem ocazia să alegem")
5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content
6. Personal opinion: While it includes personal observations, it's structured as campaign messaging

The post is clearly electoral propaganda because:
- It directly criticizes a presidential candidate (Ciolacu)
- Has a CMF number
- Makes a direct electoral call to action
- Is being promoted after the end of the presidential campaign period
- References the December 1st election
- Has significant reach through paid promotion

This violates Article 55 t) as it continues electoral propaganda after the conclusion of the official campaign period for the presidential election.
