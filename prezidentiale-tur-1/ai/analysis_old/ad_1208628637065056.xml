<analysis>
Let me analyze this according to the specified criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is present in the post

2. Candidate Reference:
- While the post doesn't explicitly name a candidate, the question "România are nevoie de un președinte mason?" appears to be targeting Mircea Geoană, who is known to be associated with Freemasonry. This is an indirect but clear reference in the context of the presidential campaign.

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- The ad reached between 200,000-249,999 impressions
- Spent between 900-999 RON
- Targeted across multiple age groups and regions
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram
- Clearly meant for mass consumption

4. Electoral Objective:
- The question is clearly designed to influence voters' opinions about a presidential candidate
- The timing during the election period makes the electoral intention clear
- The negative connotation of the question suggests an attempt to create doubt about a specific candidate

5. Journalism Standards:
- This is not journalistic content as it:
  - Poses a leading question without providing information
  - Lacks balanced reporting or factual content
  - Is clearly designed to influence rather than inform

AgentiadeInformatii.ro, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unui mesaj platit pe Facebook și Instagram (ID postare: 1208628637065056) ce constituie propagandă electorală negativă împotriva candidatului Mircea-Dan Geoană, după ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Materialul folosește o întrebare retorică cu conotații negative ("România are nevoie de un președinte mason?") pentru a influența decizia de vot a alegătorilor, atingând un public de peste 200.000 de persoane, cu o investiție de aproximativ 950 RON. Mesajul nu are caracter informativ sau jurnalistic, ci urmărește în mod evident să influențeze opțiunea de vot a alegătorilor într-o perioadă în care propaganda electorală este interzisă prin lege.
