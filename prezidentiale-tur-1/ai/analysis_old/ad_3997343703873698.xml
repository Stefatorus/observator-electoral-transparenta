Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240022" is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes - The post specifically mentions "SIMION" (GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION), a presidential candidate, and discusses his potential entry into the second round.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and targets a wide audience, specifically mentioning "argeșenii" and discussing national politics.

4. Electoral objective: Yes - While it's presented as commentary on the current political situation, it clearly has electoral objectives by:
- Promoting Forța Dreptei candidates
- Criticizing both the current government and AUR/Simion
- Making electoral promises ("nu îi vom dezamăgi")

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a political message rather than journalistic content, containing personal opinions and campaign promises.

6. Personal opinion: While it contains personal views, this is clearly a paid political advertisement with campaign messaging.

This appears to be electoral propaganda concerning both parliamentary and presidential elections, with the presidential election references being problematic as that campaign period has ended.
