Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017" - this is a clear indicator of electoral material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly mentions "Alexandru Grideanu" as candidate for Deputy position.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people), with significant impressions (30,000-34,999).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează PSD", "Votează Alexandru Grideanu Deputat").

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Brasov.

This is a clear case of electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that this is for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed, therefore this does not violate Article 55 t).

This is definitely electoral propaganda because:

- Directly asks for votes
- Names specific candidate
- Is paid advertising
- Reaches large audience
However, it's for parliamentary elections, which are still in the allowed campaign period.
