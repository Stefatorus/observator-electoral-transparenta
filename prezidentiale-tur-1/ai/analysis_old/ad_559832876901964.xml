<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions Viktor Orban (Hungarian PM) and references RMDSZ (UDMR), which is relevant because HUNOR KELEMEN from UDMR is a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (45,000-50,000 impressions) and explicitly asks for sharing ("Oszd meg!").

4. Electoral objective: The message appears to be promoting UDMR's achievements, specifically regarding Romania's Schengen accession, during an electoral period. While not directly calling for votes, it's positioning UDMR in a positive light through international recognition.

5. Journalism: This does not appear to be journalistic content as it's a paid political message with a call to action.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but rather an orchestrated political message.

The post is in Hungarian, translating to: "Viktor Orb√°n at his Friday press conference in Budapest: 'I would like to thank RMDSZ for the work they helped Romania join the Schengen area!' Share it!"
