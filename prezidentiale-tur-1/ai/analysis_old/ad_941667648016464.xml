1. <has-cmf>No CMF number is present in this post.</has-cmf>

2. <refers-to-candidate>Yes, the post refers directly to Nicolae Ciucă, who is a presidential candidate (Position 4 on the ballot).</refers-to-candidate>

3. <addresses-the-wide-population>Yes, this is a paid post with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and targets a large audience (100,001-500,000 estimated audience size).</addresses-the-wide-population>

4. <electoral-objective>No clear electoral objective is present. The content appears to be reporting on a news story about a DNA investigation regarding the use of public funds to promote Ciucă's book. This appears to be news reporting rather than electoral messaging.</electoral-objective>

5. <journalism>The content appears to be journalistic in nature, reporting on a legitimate news story about a criminal investigation. The text follows a news reporting format and deals with a matter of public interest.</journalism>

6. <personal_opinion>This is not presented as a personal opinion but rather as a news report about an ongoing investigation.</personal_opinion>

Key considerations:

- It reports on a factual event (DNA investigation)
- While it mentions a candidate, the context is news reporting rather than electoral propaganda
- The timing is sensitive (during electoral period) but the content is newsworthy regardless of elections
