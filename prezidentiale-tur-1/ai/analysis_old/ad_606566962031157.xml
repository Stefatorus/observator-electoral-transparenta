<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidates: While it mentions "candidates" generally, it's presenting an informational guide about all candidates, not promoting specific ones.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it targets Romanian voters in Moldova, with a reach of 3,000-3,999 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: This appears to be more informational than persuasive. The post aims to inform voters about their voting options and provides practical information about voting locations and times.

5. Journalism: This seems to be legitimate journalistic/civil society work, as it:
- Comes from a think tank (CRPE)
- Provides balanced information about all candidates
- Includes practical voting information
- Links to a detailed analysis on their website

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but rather an institutional communication aimed at informing voters.

The key distinction here is that this post appears to be focused on voter education and information rather than propaganda for or against any specific candidate.
