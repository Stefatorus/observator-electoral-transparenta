2. Candidate reference: The post directly mentions Marcel Ciolacu (@[100044597160869:2048:Marcel Ciolacu]), who is a presidential candidate.

3. Public addressing: The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, with a significant reach (7,000-7,999 impressions) and estimated audience size of 100,001-500,000, clearly addressing the wide population.

4. Electoral objective: While the post discusses a policy position on drug users, it's framed in the context of "viitorii parlamentari PSD din Dolj," indicating it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, not the presidential race.

5. Journalism vs Propaganda: This is clearly a political message, not journalistic content.
