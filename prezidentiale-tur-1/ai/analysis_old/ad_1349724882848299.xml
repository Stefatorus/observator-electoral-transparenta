<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly refers to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1,000,001+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears designed to diminish Ciolacu's credibility by suggesting he's lying about a conversation with Donald Trump, which could influence voters' opinions during the electoral period.

5. Journalism: While it attempts to present itself as journalistic content, the tone and presentation appear more focused on attacking the candidate's credibility rather than providing balanced, factual reporting. The language used ("minciună grosolană", "povesti") suggests a clear bias rather than objective journalism.

The timing is particularly relevant as this is being promoted after the conclusion of the presidential campaign period, and continues to run on election day.

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- Uses negative messaging to influence public opinion
- Is being distributed through paid channels during the prohibited period
- Goes beyond objective journalism with its accusatory tone
- The timing and content suggest clear electoral intentions
