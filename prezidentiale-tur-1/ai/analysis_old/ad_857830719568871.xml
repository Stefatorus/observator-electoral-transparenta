While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be targeting parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period, not the presidential election. The message is focused on Mănești area and doesn't mention any presidential candidates. The presence of a CMF number and paid distribution confirms it's campaign material, but for a different election where propaganda is still permitted.
