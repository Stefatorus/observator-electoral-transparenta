This post requires careful analysis as it's a complex political opinion piece that promotes Elena Lasconi as a presidential candidate:

1. CMF Analysis: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference: The post directly refers to Elena Lasconi, a confirmed presidential candidate, making it fall under Article 36 (7) - a.

3. Wide Population Targeting: 
- It's a paid Facebook post
- Has reached between 1,000-1,999 impressions
- Clearly addresses a wide audience with phrases like "vă invit și pe voi"

4. Electoral Objective:
- Explicitly states "De ce votez Elena Lasconi"
- Encourages others to vote for her
- Presents arguments why she would be a better president
- Directly compares her with other candidates
- Aims to influence voters' decisions

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is not journalism as it doesn't maintain objectivity
- It's clearly an opinion piece with a clear electoral objective
- Goes beyond informing to actively promoting a candidate

6. Personal Opinion Element:
While it contains personal opinions, it's structured as persuasive content meant to influence others' voting decisions, and importantly, it's being promoted through paid advertising during a period when presidential campaign advertising is prohibited.

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It's a paid promotion
- Explicitly advocates for voting for a specific presidential candidate
- Attempts to influence voters' decisions
- Uses persuasive arguments to promote one candidate over others
- Is being distributed after the end of the legal campaign period
