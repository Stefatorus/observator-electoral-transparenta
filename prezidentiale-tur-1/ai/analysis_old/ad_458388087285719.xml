Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it explicitly refers to Nicolae Ciucă, who is position #4 on the presidential candidates list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (7,000-7,999 impressions) and targets a large estimated audience (over 1 million).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears designed to damage Ciucă's electoral chances by highlighting a criminal investigation regarding his campaign spending. The timing and nature of the content suggest electoral motivation.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be presenting news, the tone and presentation suggest it goes beyond neutral journalism. The headline "Ciucă o dă în bară" (Ciucă messes up) shows editorial bias and suggests an intent to influence rather than merely inform.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a paid news article promotion with clear negative implications for a presidential candidate.

The post was created and promoted during the presidential campaign period and continues to run after the propaganda period has ended, which is problematic under Article 55 t).
