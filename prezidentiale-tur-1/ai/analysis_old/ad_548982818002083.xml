Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with significant reach (15,000-19,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While this post mentions parliamentary elections in its hashtags (#parlamentare), it primarily attacks George Simion, a presidential candidate, regarding promises about a house worth 35,000 Euro. This mixed messaging during the presidential campaign blackout period is problematic.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't follow journalistic standards. It's a direct attack without providing evidence or balanced reporting.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a paid, structured campaign message with a CMF number.

Key concerns:
- The post is active during the presidential election propaganda blackout period
- Directly attacks a presidential candidate
- Uses paid promotion to reach a wide audience
- Contains a CMF number indicating it's official campaign material
