<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it specifically mentions two presidential candidates:
- Nicolae Ciucă (PNL)
- George Simion (AUR)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement reaching potentially over 1 million people according to the estimated audience size.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content discusses polling numbers for presidential elections and positioning of candidates for the second round, which could influence voters' perceptions and decisions.

5. Journalism: While this appears to be a news article sharing polling results, the fact that it's being promoted through paid advertising during the electoral silence period changes its nature from pure journalism to potential propaganda.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece, but rather a presentation of polling data being actively promoted.

The timing is crucial here - this is being promoted after the conclusion of the official campaign period (after November 23, 2024, 18:00), making it problematic under Article 55 t).
