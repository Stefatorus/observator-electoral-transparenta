Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post refers generically to "parlamentarii PNL" and not to any specific presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a potentially wide audience in Iași.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this is clearly electoral content for the parliamentary elections, with a direct call to vote ("Pe #1decembrie, votează candidații PNL!")

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PNL Iași.

This post is electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not for the presidential election. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed, so this type of propaganda is legal.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's for the parliamentary elections:
- It contains a direct call to vote
- It's published by an official party page (PNL IASI)
- It promotes parliamentary candidates
- It's a paid advertisement
However, as this is for the parliamentary elections on December 1st, where campaigning is still allowed, it does not violate Article 55 t).
