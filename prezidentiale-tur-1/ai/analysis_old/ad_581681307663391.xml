Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240014 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: While George Simion is mentioned through "Planul Simion", this post is primarily focused on parliamentary elections ("Votați echipa AUR a județului Alba pentru Parlament pe 1 Decembrie") and not the presidential race.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people) across Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, it clearly has an electoral objective, encouraging people to vote for AUR candidates in Alba for Parliament.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official campaign communication, evidenced by the CMF number and being paid for by "I AM ONLINE SRL".

This appears to be legitimate parliamentary election propaganda, which is still allowed as the parliamentary election campaign period is ongoing. The mention of "Planul Simion" is in context of the party's governance plan rather than explicit presidential campaigning.
