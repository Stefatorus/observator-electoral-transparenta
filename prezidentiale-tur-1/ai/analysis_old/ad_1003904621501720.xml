<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is visible in the post, but this alone doesn't disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference: The post directly refers to two presidential candidates by name:
- Elena Lasconi (USR)
- Nicolae Ciucă (PNL)

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targeted to a very large audience (over 1 million potential reach)
- Has generated 8,000-8,999 impressions

4. Electoral Objective:
- The post clearly aims to influence public opinion about these candidates
- Suggests both candidates are preparing "resignation speeches"
- Uses terms like "devastatoare" and "dezastruoase" to describe their electoral prospects
- Mentions poor polling numbers to potentially discourage voters

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- Despite appearing on a news-like platform (Ropres.ro), this doesn't follow journalistic standards
- Uses sensationalist language
- Makes predictions about election outcomes before voting
- Appears designed to influence rather than inform

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but a coordinated, paid campaign
- The messaging is structured to influence voter behavior

</analysis>

<conclusion>
