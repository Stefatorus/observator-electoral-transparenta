Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Candidate Reference: The post mentions "Simion" who is a presidential candidate (GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION). It also mentions "Piedone" who is not a presidential candidate.

3. Wide Population: 
- This is a paid advertisement
- Running on both Facebook and Instagram
- High impressions (70,000-80,000)
- High estimated audience size (over 1 million)
- Significant spend (200-299 RON)
This clearly addresses a wide population.

4. Electoral Objective:
The post appears to be about an audio recording involving Simion, and claims to "demask" or "debunk" something related to it. While this could influence voters' opinions, the context suggests this is more of a news reporting nature.

5. Journalism:
- The post comes from what appears to be a news platform (5news.RO)
- The content seems to be reporting on a fact-checking exercise
- Uses expert verification ("expertul interna»õional")
- Appears to be following journalistic standards of verification

6. Personal Opinion:
This doesn't appear to be a personal opinion but rather a news report about fact-checking.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this post mentions a presidential candidate, its primary purpose appears to be news reporting rather than electoral propaganda. The content focuses on fact-checking an audio recording, which falls under journalistic activity. The presence of expert verification and the news outlet source further supports this classification.
