Let me analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: No explicit CMF number is visible in the post, though this doesn't automatically disqualify it as electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions) and targets a large estimated audience (over 1 million).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, clearly states "Susțin candidatura lui Marcel Ciolacu" and actively encourages support for his candidacy with phrases like "Trebuie să aveți încredere într-o decizie corectă" and "Aceasta este calea sigură pentru România."

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a personal endorsement and campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: While expressing personal views, it's done in a way that explicitly aims to influence voters, making it electoral propaganda rather than mere personal expression.

The post is clearly electoral propaganda as it:
- Explicitly endorses a presidential candidate
- Is being promoted after the campaign period ended
- Reaches a wide audience through paid promotion
- Has clear electoral objectives
- Is not journalistic or purely personal content
