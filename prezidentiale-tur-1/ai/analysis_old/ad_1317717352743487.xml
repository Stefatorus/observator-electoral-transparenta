Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, though this doesn't automatically disqualify it as electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly refers to "Marcel Ciolacu" as presidential candidate, positioning him and promoting his candidacy for president.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Clearly yes. The post is explicitly titled "De ce îl votează românii pe Marcel Ciolacu ca președinte al României" and promotes his candidacy with specific points aimed at convincing people to vote for him.

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's purely promotional material listing reasons to vote for the candidate.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured, paid advertisement from "Infomed Pro SRL" promoting a presidential candidate.

This is clearly electoral propaganda because:
- It directly promotes a presidential candidate
- Has clear electoral objectives
- Is paid advertising reaching a wide audience
- Lists specific reasons why people should vote for the candidate
- Is running after the end of the legal campaign period
