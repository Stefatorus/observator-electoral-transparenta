<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: This post doesn't directly mention any presidential candidates. It focuses on local parliamentary elections and PSD's projects for Grecești.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting residents of Grecești area, with an estimated reach of 1,001-5,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this is clearly electoral content for the parliamentary elections, evidenced by the closing statement "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Grecești!"

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a campaign promise list.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj.

Important context: This advertisement is focused on the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

This is indeed electoral propaganda, but it's LEGAL propaganda because:
- It targets parliamentary elections, not presidential
- The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still active
- It makes no reference to presidential candidates or presidential elections
- It focuses exclusively on local development projects and parliamentary elections
