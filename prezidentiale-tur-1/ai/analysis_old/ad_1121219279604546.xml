<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's focused on the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. Therefore, while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it doesn't relate to the presidential election where the propaganda period has ended.
