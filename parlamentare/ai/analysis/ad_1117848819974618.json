While the message itself is relatively generic, its placement as a paid advertisement during or after the electoral campaign period (end_date: 1732953600, which corresponds to November 23, 2024, after 18:00) and its clear intention to positively portray the party constitute electoral propaganda. The post targets a wide audience in Gorj County, Romania, as evidenced by the ad's targeting data.  The spend is significant (RON1.5K - RON2K), indicating a deliberate effort to influence voters.  The lack of journalistic objectivity further strengthens the classification as propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number is not a decisive factor, as the post's content and context clearly indicate its propagandistic nature.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>For\u021ba Dreptei</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Tele 3 Media</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTele 3 Media, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1117848819974618) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul For\u021ba Dreptei cu mesajul \"Echipa For\u021ba Dreptei aduce \u00eempreun\u0103 profesioni\u0219ti dedica\u021bi pentru un viitor mai bun\", av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv asupra partidului men\u021bionat.
