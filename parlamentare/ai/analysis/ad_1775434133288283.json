While not explicitly urging voters to vote for a specific candidate, the post's clear objective is to favorably portray the PSD and influence voters positively. The targeting of senior citizens in Alba County, coupled with the promotional language and lack of journalistic objectivity, strongly suggests an intention to influence the election outcome. The post fulfills all criteria of electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The timing of the post, after the official end of the electoral campaign, further strengthens the case for a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul Social Democrat (PSD)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMedia Smart SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1775434133288283) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 o ini\u021biativ\u0103 a Partidului Social Democrat (PSD) f\u0103r\u0103 neutralitate jurnalistic\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea pozitiv\u0103 a voturilor pentru PSD.
