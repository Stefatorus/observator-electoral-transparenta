While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate, the indirect electoral benefit is significant. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) needs to be verified against the electoral calendar. If the post was published after the legal deadline for electoral propaganda, it would be a clear violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Sebastian - Tiberiu Pop</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPop Sebastian Tiberiu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (verificare necesar\u0103 a datei exacte), cu ID-ul 1120855423004477, care promoveaz\u0103 o propunere legislativ\u0103 privind salariile \u0219oferilor de camion, con\u021bin\u00e2nd un cod CMF11240003,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea popularit\u0103\u021bii candidatului \u0219i influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea sa.
