It refers directly to a candidate (Sebastian-Tiberiu Pop), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the exact end date is not specified, the post's metadata suggests it was active during the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for the candidate), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by actively promoting a specific political agenda. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content, while discussing civic education, is framed within the context of the candidate's platform and implicitly encourages voters to support him.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Pop Sebastian Tiberiu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 392299580540497) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Pop Sebastian Tiberiu pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea PNCR, prezent\u00e2nd ini\u021biativa sa legislativ\u0103 privind educa\u021bia civic\u0103 \u00eentr-un mod care dep\u0103\u0219e\u0219te limitele jurnalismului \u0219i are ca scop influen\u021barea votului.
