The message explicitly urges voters to support REPER.  While the ad doesn't contain a CMF number, the clear call to action, targeting of a specific region, and paid nature of the post strongly suggest it constitutes electoral propaganda. The post's objective is undeniably to influence the outcome of the election. The end date of the ad (1732867200, which corresponds to November 30th, 2024) is before the election day, but the post is still problematic because it is a paid advertisement that directly promotes a candidate.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>REPER</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 486555060504441), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba voteaz\u0103 REPER pe 1 decembrie!\",  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea partidului REPER.
