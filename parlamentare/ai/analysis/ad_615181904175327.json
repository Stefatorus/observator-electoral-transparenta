It refers directly to a candidate (Sorin Cristian Alic), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as after the election, the image and text clearly indicate it was published before), has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes for Alic and AUR), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this classification.  The paid nature of the Facebook post and its wide reach solidify its status as electoral propaganda.  The fact that the end date is given as after the election is problematic, as it suggests the post may have remained active after the legal campaign period ended.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Sorin Cristian Alic</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRLX Vision Digital SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 615181904175327) cu con\u021binut de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Sorin Cristian Alic (AUR) pentru func\u021bia de senator.
