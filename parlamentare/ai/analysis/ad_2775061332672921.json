The post does not refer to any parliamentary candidate.  It promotes a service offered by the Eurotrans Foundation, providing information about their outreach program in Hunedoara County. While the RMDSZ (Romanian Democratic Union of Hungarians) logo is present, this does not constitute a direct reference to a specific candidate participating in the parliamentary elections. The logo's presence is more likely related to the foundation's partnership or affiliation, not an endorsement of a particular candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience in Hunedoara County, Romania, not just a select few individuals. The use of paid advertising inherently implies a desire for broad reach.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post is to inform the public about the Eurotrans Foundation's outreach program and its services, not to influence voting patterns in the parliamentary elections. The post focuses on providing information about the location and timing of the foundation's services, not on advocating for or against any candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post provides information, it does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and is promotional in nature, focusing on the services of a specific organization. It does not present news, analysis, or opinions on political events.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Not applicable. The post does not express personal opinions; it is a factual announcement of services.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>2775061332672921</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post does not violate Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. The post promotes a community outreach program by the Eurotrans Foundation, providing information about their services in Hunedoara County. While the RMDSZ logo is present, there is no direct or indirect endorsement of any candidate participating in the parliamentary elections. The post's objective is to inform the public about the foundation's services, not to influence voting behavior.  The presence of the RMDSZ logo, without further context linking it to electoral campaigning, is insufficient to classify this as electoral propaganda. The post does not advise voters at polling stations or engage in any other form of prohibited electoral activity.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Eurotrans Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
