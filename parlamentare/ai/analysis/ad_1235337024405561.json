It directly addresses the public, urging them to vote for him on December 1st. The post highlights his plans to support entrepreneurs and boasts about the government's success in absorbing EU funds. While it mentions economic policies, the overall tone and purpose are clearly electoral, aiming to influence voters' decisions. The image accompanying the post further reinforces this, showing the candidate in a setting that suggests a campaign event.  The post fulfills all criteria of electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The fact that it was published after the official campaign period ended (assuming the post's end_date reflects this) constitutes a violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Dumitru Rujan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nDumitru Rujan, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (conform datei de \u00eencheiere a post\u0103rii din arhiva de reclame), cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor \u00een favoarea sa, prin promovarea candidaturii sale la alegerile parlamentare \u0219i prin eviden\u021bierea unor realiz\u0103ri guvernamentale,  av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar,  \u00eencalc\u00e2nd astfel prevederile legale privind perioada de campanie electoral\u0103.
