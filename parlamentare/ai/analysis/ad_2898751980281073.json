The post's concluding sentence directly urges voters to choose candidates they believe deserve representation in Parliament.  While the initial part expresses personal sentiments, the overall message is clearly designed to influence voting behavior. The use of a paid Facebook advertisement ensures wide dissemination, fulfilling the criteria of addressing the public. The post's timing, close to the election, further strengthens the argument that it constitutes electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number is not a decisive factor, as the context and content clearly indicate an electoral objective.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Andrei Plujar</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Cara\u0219-Severin, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 2898751980281073), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul \u00een alegerile parlamentare.
