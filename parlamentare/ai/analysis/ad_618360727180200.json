The post refers to Lauren\u021biu Nistor, president of PSD Hunedoara County, and mentions the USR minister Ghi\u021b\u0103. While not explicitly mentioning a candidate for the parliamentary elections, it implicitly links the actions of a USR minister to the PSD's counter-actions, thus indirectly influencing voters' perception of both parties.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and the content is presented as a news report, aiming to reach a wide audience, not just a specific individual.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While presented as a news report, the content highlights a negative action by a USR minister and a positive counter-action by the PSD. This framing could sway voters' opinions in favor of the PSD and against the USR, thus having an electoral objective. The timing of the post is also relevant; if it's close to the election, the impact is amplified.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post is formatted like a news report, but its content is biased and lacks the neutrality expected from objective journalism. It selectively presents information to favor the PSD.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it presents information in a way that promotes a specific political narrative.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>618360727180200</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while disguised as a news report, exhibits characteristics of electoral propaganda. It mentions specific politicians from competing parties (PSD and USR), highlighting actions that could influence voters' perceptions. The framing of the information is biased, favoring the PSD. The fact that it's a paid advertisement on Facebook, targeting a wide audience in Hunedoara County, further strengthens the argument that it aims to influence the election.  However, it does not directly advocate for voting for or against any specific candidate. The lack of a CMF number weakens the case, but the other factors outweigh this.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be considered.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Lauren\u021biu Nistor</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>USR Minister Ghi\u021b\u0103 (unnamed)</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Quantum TV</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nQuantum TV, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 618360727180200), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i prezentat\u0103 sub forma unei \u0219tiri, con\u021bine informa\u021bii tenden\u021bioase ce favorizeaz\u0103 PSD \u0219i denigreaz\u0103 USR.

Efectul electoral al acestei post\u0103ri este clar: influen\u021barea opiniei publice \u00een favoarea PSD \u0219i \u00eempotriva USR.  Con\u021binutul manipulativ, distribuirea pe o platform\u0103 public\u0103 precum Facebook \u0219i plata pentru promovare (peste 100 RON, conform Ad Library) demonstreaz\u0103 inten\u021bia de a influen\u021ba alegerile.
