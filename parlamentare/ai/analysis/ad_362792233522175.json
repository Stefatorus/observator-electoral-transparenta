The post explicitly mentions AUR (Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor), a parliamentary candidate party.  It references a statement made by a member of AUR, thus directly relating to a political party participating in the elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The post is not a private message or personal communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While the post doesn't explicitly urge people to vote for or against AUR, it presents information intended to create a negative perception of AUR. This could indirectly influence voters' choices. The fact that it's a paid advertisement suggests an intention to shape public opinion, which is an electoral objective.  The negative portrayal of AUR's statement could sway voters away from them.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about a statement made by an AUR member. However, the framing of the information is clearly biased and lacks the neutrality expected from journalistic reporting. The headline \"Manelistul Dani Mocanu nu voteaz\u0103 AUR\" is sensationalist and suggestive, rather than objective.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While it might be argued that this is a personal opinion of Dani Mocanu, the post is presented as news and uses this opinion to negatively portray AUR. The context of a paid advertisement on a public platform makes it unlikely to be considered a purely personal opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>362792233522175</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while presenting factual information about a statement made by an AUR member, frames this information in a biased and potentially manipulative way.  The use of a paid advertisement to disseminate this information, targeting a wide audience, strongly suggests an intention to influence voters' perceptions of AUR.  The lack of neutrality and the sensationalist headline point towards electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't explicitly call for a vote for or against any candidate, the negative portrayal of AUR could be interpreted as an attempt to negatively influence the outcome of the election.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a concern.  However, the exact date of the post is not specified, so it's difficult to definitively say if it violates the post-election propaganda ban.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>AUR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Info360</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInfo360, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 362792233522175), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu con\u021binut care prezint\u0103 \u00eentr-un mod tenden\u021bios \u0219i manipulativ o declara\u021bie a unui membru AUR, influen\u021b\u00e2nd negativ percep\u021bia publicului asupra partidului.
