While it doesn't explicitly name a party, the call to vote on Sunday, coupled with the targeting of specific regions in Romania and the mention of \"Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103,\" strongly suggests an attempt to influence the parliamentary elections.  The lack of a CMF number is not definitive, but the other factors heavily weigh towards this being a violation.  The post's objective is clearly to encourage voting for a specific individual, likely a candidate, thus fulfilling the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The timing of the post is critical; if it occurred after the official campaign period ended, it would be a clear violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 2723665604473614), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103: K\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9g\u00fcnk j\u00f6v\u0151je forog kock\u00e1n.
