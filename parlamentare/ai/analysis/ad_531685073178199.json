The post's language (\"Votam masiv,\" \"Alaturati-va noua\") directly encourages voters to support a specific candidate.  The post targets a wide audience through paid advertising on Facebook, and the hashtags further increase its reach.  The post's objective is clearly to influence the election outcome by increasing votes for Cioaca and ADN.  While it doesn't contain a CMF number, the other elements strongly suggest it's electoral propaganda.  The post's timing (after the official campaign period) is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Emanuel Cioaca</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FRP</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFederatia Romanilor de Pretutindeni, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei postari pe Facebook (ID 531685073178199) cu scopul de a influenta votul in favoarea candidatului Emanuel Cioaca (ADN) la alegerile parlamentare, folosind fraze precum \"Votam masiv\" si \"Alaturati-va noua\" intr-o campanie platita (RON300-RON399) care a atins 10.000-15.000 de impresii, cu o estimare a raspandirii de 500.000-1.000.000 de persoane, avand in vedere ca perioada de campanie electorala s-a incheiat,  constituie propaganda electorala interzisa.
