Phrases like \"Hai la vot!\", \"Vota\u021bi echipa USR\", and the warning about potential negative consequences of voting for other parties (\"Un Parlament cu extremi\u015fti sau pro-ru\u015fi...\") directly aim to influence voting behavior.

It refers to a specific political party (USR), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for USR), and uses persuasive language rather than objective journalism. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing (after the official campaign period) is also a significant factor.  While the exact end date of the campaign is not specified, the context suggests it's likely a violation if the campaign period has ended.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Brian Cristian], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 1279326216711414, care promoveaz\u0103 USR prin mesaje persuasive precum \"Hai la vot!\", \"Vota\u021bi echipa USR\" \u0219i avertismente despre consecin\u021bele vot\u0103rii altor partide, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a voturilor \u00een favoarea USR.
