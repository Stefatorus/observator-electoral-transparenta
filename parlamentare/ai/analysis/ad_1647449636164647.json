The call to action is general (\"choose your voice\"), not directed towards a specific candidate or party.  While the post is paid for and targets a large audience, the lack of explicit advocacy for a particular candidate makes it difficult to classify it definitively as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being electoral propaganda.  The \"choose your voice\" message could be interpreted as encouraging participation in the democratic process, rather than influencing votes for a specific candidate.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ/UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
