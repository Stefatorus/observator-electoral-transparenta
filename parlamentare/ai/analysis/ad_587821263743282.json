The post explicitly mentions \"candidates\" participating in the parliamentary elections and refers to their controversial statements and actions. While it doesn't name specific candidates, it directly relates to individuals running for office.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and the content is presented as a news article targeting a broad audience interested in the Romanian parliamentary elections. The reach estimate of 500K-1M further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While presented as a news article, the post highlights negative aspects of certain candidates' behavior and statements. This could potentially influence voters' choices by creating a negative perception of those candidates. The title itself is sensationalist and designed to attract attention.  The use of strong language (\"Prin\u021beso, sugi p***!\") is highly provocative and unlikely to be used in neutral reporting. The overall tone and selection of information suggest an intention to influence voters, even if indirectly.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post is formatted like a news article, but the selection of information and the sensationalist title raise questions about its objectivity. The focus on negative aspects of candidates' behavior, without providing a balanced perspective, suggests a potential bias. The use of inflammatory language further undermines its journalistic integrity.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; rather, it presents information in a manner designed to shape public perception of candidates.

It targets the parliamentary elections, directly referencing candidates and their actions. The sensationalist title and inflammatory language are designed to attract attention and potentially influence voters' opinions negatively towards certain candidates. Although it doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose any specific candidate, the selective presentation of negative information and the overall tone strongly suggest an intention to sway public opinion. The fact that it's a paid advertisement on a public platform further strengthens this interpretation.  The counter-argument is that it's a news article, but the lack of objectivity and the use of inflammatory language weaken this defense.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>info-sud-est.ro</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInfo Sud-Est, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 587821263743282), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu con\u021binut ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103,  av\u00e2nd ca efect influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a opiniei publice asupra unor candida\u021bi la alegerile parlamentare.
