The paid nature of the Facebook post, its targeting, and its clear call to action to vote all point towards electoral propaganda. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) is crucial.  While the post itself doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) in terms of content, its purpose and context strongly suggest it is intended to influence the vote. The fact that it is a paid advertisement targeting a specific candidate during a period when such advertising is prohibited makes it a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1210400386734563, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Manolache Vasile la Senat, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv prin \u00eendemnul explicit la vot (\"votul t\u0103u pentru Parlament conteaz\u0103 enorm!\", \"vino la urne \u0219i fii parte din schimbare!\").
