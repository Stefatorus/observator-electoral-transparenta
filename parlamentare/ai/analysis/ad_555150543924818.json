While not explicitly mentioning the parliamentary elections, the strong association with AUR and the clear call to action to vote for Simion strongly suggests an attempt to influence the parliamentary elections indirectly. The post uses persuasive language, targets a wide audience in Hunedoara County, and contains a CMF number, all indicating electoral propaganda.  The post's objective is clearly to garner support for AUR, even if not directly stated for the parliamentary elections.  The timing of the post, considering the provided date, is also relevant.  The only counterargument would be that the post focuses on presidential elections, but the strong link to AUR and the clear intent to influence voters makes this a weak argument.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>George Simion</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAUR - S\u0103la\u0219u de Sus, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 555150543924818) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 indirect candidatul George Simion la pre\u0219edin\u021bie, asociindu-l cu AUR \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru acesta, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar asupra alegerilor parlamentare.
