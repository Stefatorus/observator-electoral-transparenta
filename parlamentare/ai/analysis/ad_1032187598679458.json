This strongly suggests it is electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are used for campaign finance reporting and are mandated for political advertising.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>While the post doesn't explicitly name a parliamentary candidate, it clearly refers to a team (\"#EchipaValeriuIftime\") associated with Valeriu Iftime, who is likely a candidate for a local election (Primaria Leorda). The image shows a group of people, presumably associated with the PNL party, suggesting an endorsement of a local candidate.  This is not directly related to the parliamentary elections, but it is still a form of political advertising.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  It's not a private message; it's public and promoted.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective appears to be promoting the \"EchipaValeriuIftime\" team, which strongly suggests an electoral objective. The post aims to increase awareness and potentially support for this team in the local elections. While not directly influencing the parliamentary vote, it is still political advertising with an electoral goal.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It's promotional in nature, focusing on endorsing a specific team of candidates.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content is not a personal opinion; it's a clearly structured promotional message for a political team. The use of images and the CMF number further reinforces this.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1032187598679458</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not directly related to the parliamentary elections, is a form of electoral propaganda. The presence of a CMF number, the clear endorsement of a political team (\"#EchipaValeriuIftime\"), the paid advertisement format on a public platform, and the images all point towards an attempt to influence voters in a local election.  While the specific candidates are not named in the text, the context and imagery strongly suggest an endorsement.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak; the lack of direct mention of parliamentary candidates is not sufficient to negate the clear electoral intent.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Na\u021bional Liberal - filiala Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu ID-ul 1032187598679458, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 echipa \u201e#EchipaValeriuIftime\u201d,  av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin promovarea indirect\u0103 a candidatului Valeriu Iftime la alegerile locale pentru Prim\u0103ria Leorda.
