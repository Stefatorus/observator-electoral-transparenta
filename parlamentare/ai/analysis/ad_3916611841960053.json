While the subject matter is undeniably political and related to the election, the post itself does not constitute electoral propaganda. It presents factual information about the protests without explicitly advocating for or against any candidate. The call to action is implicit in the protests themselves, not in the post's content.  The post's journalistic style and objective reporting further support this conclusion.  The fact that the protests occurred after the first round of voting is relevant but doesn't automatically make the reporting of them electoral propaganda.  The post does not advise voters at polling stations or directly influence the vote.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>C\\u0103lin Georgescu</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Mediashare</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
