While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being considered electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be officially sanctioned campaign material.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"F\u0103r\u0103 Lasconi la cotroceni!\".  Elena-Valeria Lasconi is a candidate for the presidential elections, not the parliamentary elections. While the post expresses an opinion against her candidacy, it does not directly promote or oppose any candidate in the parliamentary elections.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not strictly apply to the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The reach estimate is \">1M\", confirming its broad targeting.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post seems to be expressing an opinion against Elena-Valeria Lasconi's presidential candidacy. While it could indirectly influence voters' perceptions, it doesn't directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. The connection to the parliamentary elections is tenuous at best. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c is not clearly met regarding the parliamentary elections.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It's a concise statement of opinion, not an analysis or news report. It lacks the objectivity and factual basis expected of journalism.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post expresses a strong personal opinion against a presidential candidate. While it's a forceful statement, it's framed as an opinion, not a call to action for or against any parliamentary candidate.  The context is crucial here; it's not disguised as objective information or a subtle attempt to influence the parliamentary vote.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1204210117341510</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post expresses a strong opinion against a presidential candidate, but it does not directly promote or oppose any candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  The lack of a CMF number and the indirect, if any, relation to the parliamentary elections weaken the case for considering it electoral propaganda concerning the parliamentary elections. While the post is a paid advertisement with a wide reach, its content focuses on a presidential candidate and doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any parliamentary candidate.  The argument for it being electoral propaganda related to the parliamentary elections is weak.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Elena-Valeria Lasconi</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
