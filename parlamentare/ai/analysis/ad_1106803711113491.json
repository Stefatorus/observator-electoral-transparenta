The post explicitly mentions the PSD (Partidul Social Democrat) and implicitly refers to its candidates by showing their pictures.  While it doesn't name specific candidates, the visual representation clearly links the post to the PSD and its participation in the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The post's content and the targeting parameters (Constanta County, broad age range) further support this conclusion.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The post aims to influence voters' opinions by portraying the PSD in a positive light (\"Bravo PSD Constanta!\") and negatively portraying opposing parties (PNL, AUR, USR) as an \"austerity alliance\" (\"Alianta Austeritate\"). The headline \"Noul PSD OPRIT!\" and the image directly comparing the PSD to other parties clearly suggest an electoral objective to garner support for the PSD.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post uses some journalistic elements (images, headline), its primary purpose is not objective reporting. The biased language, the clear support for the PSD, and the lack of balanced presentation of different viewpoints indicate that it is not journalistic in nature. It's more of a form of political propaganda.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it promotes a political party and its agenda. The language used is not that of a personal opinion but rather a political statement intended to influence voters.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1106803711113491</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by \"Surse Interne,\" clearly constitutes electoral propaganda. It fulfills all the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006: it directly refers to the PSD, a party participating in the parliamentary elections; it was published during the electoral campaign period; its objective is to influence voters in favor of the PSD; and it goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by presenting a biased and overtly supportive portrayal of the PSD. The visual comparison with other parties further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's targeting parameters and the spend amount indicate an intention to reach a significant number of voters in Constanta County.  The post's content, including the headline \"Noul PSD OPRIT!\", the image, and the text \"Bravo PSD Constanta!\", directly promotes the PSD and aims to influence the outcome of the elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD Candidates in Constanta</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL, AUR, USR Candidates in Constanta</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Surse Interne</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSurse Interne, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1106803711113491), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103.
