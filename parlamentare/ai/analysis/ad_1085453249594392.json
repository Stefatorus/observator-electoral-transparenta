The presence of a CMF number, the paid advertisement format on Facebook, the targeting of a specific demographic, and the timing during the election period all point towards an attempt to influence voters.  The vague message, while seemingly innocuous, serves to create a positive association with \"Sorin Na\u0219\" without directly advocating for a vote.  The lack of explicit mention of a candidate is a mitigating factor, but the overall context strongly suggests a violation.  The \"Learn More\" CTA linking to Sorin Na\u0219's Facebook page further strengthens this interpretation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Sorin Na\u0219</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>ALVERNA CONNECT SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nALVERNA CONNECT SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1085453249594392, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, con\u021bine un num\u0103r CMF (11240027), este direc\u021bionat\u0103 c\u0103tre un public specific \u0219i are ca scop influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea lui Sorin Na\u0219 prin asocierea acestuia cu valori tradi\u021bionale.
