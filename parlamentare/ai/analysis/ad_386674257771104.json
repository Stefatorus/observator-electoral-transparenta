The post explicitly mentions \"PSD\" (Partidul Social Democrat) and implies a connection to G.

This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The reach estimate (100K-500K) further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The post's statement \"INCREDIBIL CE FACE PSD pentru a-l avea pe G. Simion in turul 2\" (\"INCREDIBLE WHAT PSD IS DOING TO HAVE G.

The post's paid nature, wide reach, and clear intention to influence voters' opinions strongly suggest a violation.  The lack of journalistic objectivity and the use of sensational language further reinforce this conclusion. While the post doesn't directly advocate for or against a specific candidate, its impact is clearly intended to negatively influence voters' perception of the PSD, potentially affecting their voting decisions.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>G.
