The overall objective appears to be promoting her candidacy and influencing voters to support her. This strongly suggests an electoral objective, fulfilling Article 36 (7) - c. The phrasing \"Eu nu sunt de v\u00e2nzare\" (\"I am not for sale\") is a clear attempt to contrast her with other candidates and portray her as incorruptible, a common tactic in electoral campaigns.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic in nature.

The post's content directly promotes her candidacy, highlighting her views and emphasizing her commitment to her constituents.  The targeting parameters (age, location) further suggest an attempt to influence voters in Suceava County. While lacking a CMF number, the post's explicit mention of the candidate, its clear electoral objective, and its dissemination via a paid Facebook advertisement strongly indicate it constitutes electoral propaganda.  The post's message, particularly the phrase \"Eu nu sunt de v\u00e2nzare,\" is designed to sway voters' opinions.  The absence of journalistic objectivity further supports this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Larisa Blanari</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInformatia ta, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei postari pe Facebook (ID 607073918491384) cu caracter de propaganda electorala, care promoveaza candidatura Larisei Blanari, candidat PSD la Camera Deputatilor,  prin prezentarea opiniilor sale si accentuarea angajamentului sau fata de alegatori.  Postarea, platita cu o suma sub 100 RON, a atins o audienta estimata intre 2000 si 3000 de impresii, cu o estimare a raspandirii intre 100.000 si 500.000 de persoane, in principal in judetul Suceava.  Textul postarii, in special fraza \"Eu nu sunt de v\u00e2nzare\", are un efect electoral clar, vizand influentarea votului in favoarea candidatei.  Lipsa obiectivitatii jurnalistice si contextul publicitar platit demonstreaza intentia de a influenta procesul electoral.
