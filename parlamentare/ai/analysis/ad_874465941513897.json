There is no mention of any parliamentary candidate or party, nor any attempt to influence voters. The post's content and objective are entirely unrelated to the parliamentary elections. While it's a paid advertisement, its purpose is not electoral propaganda.  The fact that the advertiser is a government official does not automatically make the post electoral propaganda; the content itself must be analyzed. In this case, the content is benign and celebratory.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
