The paid nature of the post further reinforces this conclusion. While the absence of a CMF number is not definitive, the other factors heavily outweigh this absence.  The post's design and wording are clearly aimed at promoting Valeriu Iftime's candidacy.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 444817985328121), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Valeriu Iftime la alegerile parlamentare.
