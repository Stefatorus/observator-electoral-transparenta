The post is a public Facebook post, paid for and intended to reach a wide audience, not a private communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post is to share information about Dumitru Flucus's participation in a religious event at M\u0103n\u0103stirea Prislop, commemorating Father Arsenie Boca.  There is no explicit or implicit call to vote for him or any political party. The mention of his role as a deputy is incidental and not the focus of the post.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially True. The post could be considered a form of citizen journalism, documenting a public event. However, the fact that it's a paid advertisement raises questions about its purely journalistic intent.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express a personal opinion unrelated to the elections. It describes a public event attended by the politician.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>2779144615601838</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post primarily focuses on Dumitru Flucus's attendance at a religious event. While he is a politician and a deputy, the post's content does not promote his candidacy or any political party. The post lacks any explicit or implicit calls to vote for him or any political affiliation.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement is a factor to consider, but the content itself does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post does not directly refer to a candidate in the context of the parliamentary elections, nor does it have an electoral objective.  The image accompanying the post further supports this, showing a religious event, not a political rally.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Dumitru Flucus</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
