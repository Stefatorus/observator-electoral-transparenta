The hashtags used (#PNRR, #rogobete, #sanatatepentruoameni, #grijabuna, #grijabunapentrusanatate) are related to his role as Secretary of State in the Ministry of Health and the PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan), not to a specific parliamentary candidate or party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.

The post's objective appears to be promoting Alexandru Rogobete's work related to healthcare and the PNRR. While he is a public figure, the content doesn't directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. The focus is on healthcare improvements, not influencing votes.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially.

However, it lacks the objectivity and journalistic standards expected in news reporting. It's more of a promotional piece than a journalistic one.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express a personal opinion unrelated to the electoral process. It promotes the work of a public figure, which is not inherently a personal opinion in this context.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1971993493275526</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post by Alexandru Rogobete promotes his work as Secretary of State in the Ministry of Health and his involvement with the PNRR.  While it's a paid advertisement targeting a large audience, it lacks direct references to any parliamentary candidates or parties. The hashtags and message focus on healthcare improvements, not influencing votes in the parliamentary elections.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post does not violate Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015 because it does not constitute electoral propaganda related to the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
