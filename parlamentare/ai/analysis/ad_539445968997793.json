There is no mention of any political candidate, party, or any content related to the parliamentary elections. The post's objective is purely promotional, aiming to inform the public about a community event.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically qualify it as electoral propaganda if the content itself is unrelated to the elections.  The fact that the advertiser, Mihai Poli\u021beanu, is a public figure (Mayor of Ploie\u0219ti) does not automatically make the post electoral propaganda. The content is entirely separate from any electoral campaign.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
