The post's objective is to influence voters' perception of Costel Barbu and potentially sway their votes in his favor. While the post doesn't explicitly urge people to vote for him, the implicit message is clear.  The image further enhances this by showing a positive development project.  The only mitigating factor is the lack of explicit mention of Barbu's candidacy. However, given the context, this is insufficient to negate the clear intent of electoral influence.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Costel Barbu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Total Impact</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTotal Impact, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 876541257633872) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 imaginea lui Costel Barbu, asociind numele s\u0103u cu un proiect de dezvoltare important \u00een comuna Suhaia, finan\u021bat din fonduri guvernamentale.
