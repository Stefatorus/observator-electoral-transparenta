The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name, surname, or any other clear identifier.  The website promotes itself as providing political news from multiple perspectives, not endorsing any specific candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The reach estimate is \">1M\", indicating a broad targeting strategy.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The objective appears to be to drive traffic to a website offering political news and information. While this information *could* be used to influence voting decisions, the post itself doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any candidate. The website's name, \"Afla pe cine votezi\" (Find out who to vote for), is suggestive, but the post itself only promotes the website, not a specific candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially True. The description suggests the website provides news from multiple perspectives, which aligns with journalistic practices. However, the lack of transparency about the website's editorial process and potential biases prevents a definitive conclusion. Further investigation into the website's content would be necessary.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Not applicable.

While the website's name suggests an electoral objective, the post itself does not directly advocate for or against any specific candidate. The post's aim seems to be increasing website traffic, not directly influencing votes.  The post does not violate Article 36 (7) a, b, or c because it does not directly refer to a candidate, it is not within the electoral campaign period (according to the provided end date), and while the website's name suggests an electoral objective, the post itself does not explicitly promote a candidate.  The argument for it being electoral propaganda is weak, relying on inference rather than direct evidence.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle applies here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Afla pe cine votezi</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
