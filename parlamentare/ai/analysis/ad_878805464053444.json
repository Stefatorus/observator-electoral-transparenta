It addresses a social issue (violence against women) and promotes a helpline. The content does not mention any parliamentary candidates, parties, or attempt to influence voting behavior in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The post's objective is purely informational and socially beneficial.  The timing of the post (around the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) further supports its non-electoral nature.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
