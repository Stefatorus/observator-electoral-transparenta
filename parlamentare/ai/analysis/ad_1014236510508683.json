This strongly suggests an attempt at electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are used by candidates and parties to comply with Romanian electoral regulations.  The presence of a CMF number is a significant indicator of intent to influence voters.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any parliamentary candidate by name or surname. However, the \"USR Maramures\" byline strongly implies affiliation with the USR party, which is participating in the parliamentary elections. While not directly naming a candidate, the association is clear and could be interpreted as indirectly promoting the party and its candidates.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The content is not a private message but a public statement intended for broad dissemination. The reach estimate (50K-100K) further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's content focuses on themes of freedom, democracy, and the dangers of returning to a past authoritarian regime. While not explicitly urging voters to support a specific candidate, the overall message strongly aligns with the USR party's platform and aims to create a positive association with the party's values. This implicitly encourages voters to support the party and its candidates. The timing of the post, close to the election, further strengthens this interpretation.  The call to action to \"defend our freedom\" and \"remain united\" is a clear attempt to mobilize voters.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity and neutrality. It presents a strongly partisan viewpoint, promoting a specific political ideology and implicitly endorsing a particular party. While it touches upon historical events, it does so in a manner clearly designed to influence voters' opinions and actions, rather than providing objective information.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post transcends personal opinion. It's a carefully crafted message using evocative language and historical references to promote a political agenda. The use of paid advertising on a public platform further indicates an intention to influence public opinion on a large scale, beyond the expression of a personal viewpoint.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1014236510508683</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly mentioning any candidate by name, strongly suggests electoral propaganda due to the presence of a CMF number, the clear affiliation with the USR party, the targeted messaging aimed at influencing voters, and the use of paid advertising on a public platform. The content, while framed around broader themes of freedom and democracy, serves to implicitly promote the USR party and its candidates. The post's timing, close to the election, further strengthens this interpretation.  The arguments presented are not objective journalistic analysis but rather persuasive rhetoric designed to sway public opinion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 1014236510508683) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu un buget de 100-199 RON, care con\u021bine un num\u0103r CMF (CMF 11240015),  \u0219i promoveaz\u0103 indirect USR printr-un mesaj care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 candida\u021bi anumi\u021bi,  folose\u0219te limbaj emo\u021bional \u0219i referin\u021be istorice pentru a crea o asociere pozitiv\u0103 cu valorile partidului, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea electoratului \u00een favoarea USR.
