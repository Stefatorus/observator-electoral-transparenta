While not explicitly calling for votes, the positive portrayal of Geoan\u0103 and the party aims to influence voters' choices. The post targets a wide audience through Facebook advertising, fulfilling the criteria of electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post's timing, after the official end of the electoral campaign, further strengthens the case for a violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.  The post's content, focusing on the positive aspects of PRA and its association with Mircea Geoan\u0103, clearly aims to sway public opinion in favor of the party. The paid nature of the post, reaching an estimated 10K-50K people, amplifies its potential impact.  The lack of a CMF number does not negate the promotional nature of the post.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Geoan\u0103</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Opinii Independente</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nOpinii Independente, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1281676142849091), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune (PRA) prin eviden\u021bierea implic\u0103rii lui Mircea Geoan\u0103, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv asupra PRA.
