While the party might benefit from positive publicity, the post's content and objective do not constitute electoral propaganda. It does not mention any parliamentary candidates, nor does it explicitly or implicitly encourage voting for or against any candidate. The post focuses on a local issue and the party's actions, which falls under acceptable forms of communication, not electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post (after the parliamentary election period) is irrelevant because it does not relate to the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Partidul C\u00e2mpina Curat\u0103</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
