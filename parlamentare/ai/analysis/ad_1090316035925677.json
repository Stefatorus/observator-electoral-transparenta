While the topic has political undertones, the post itself does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. The post's primary goal is to inform the public about the foundation's services, not to influence voting behavior. The targeting data shows a broad reach across multiple counties, but this does not automatically qualify it as electoral propaganda.  The lack of any explicit mention of candidates or parties, combined with the clear focus on the foundation's services, suggests that this post does not violate Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Eurotrans Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
