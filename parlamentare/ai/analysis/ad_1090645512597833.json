The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or affiliation.  While it encourages voting for those who support the application of laws against domestic violence, it doesn't endorse any particular candidate or party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The targeting parameters (age, gender, location) further confirm this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True, but weak. The post's primary objective appears to be raising awareness about domestic violence and encouraging voters to support candidates with a strong stance on this issue.  However, it could be interpreted as indirectly influencing the vote by promoting a specific policy position that might align with certain candidates or parties. The connection is not direct, making this a weaker argument.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post addresses a matter of public interest, it lacks the objectivity and journalistic standards expected of news reporting or analysis. It's primarily an advocacy message, not an informative one.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. This is not a personal opinion; it's a structured message promoting a specific policy goal related to elections, even if indirectly.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1090645512597833</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post promotes a policy position (stronger laws against domestic violence) relevant to the electoral process. While it doesn't explicitly endorse any candidate, it could indirectly influence voters by encouraging them to support candidates aligned with this position.  The lack of direct candidate mention and the focus on a broader social issue weakens the case for a clear violation.  However, the paid nature of the post and its targeting towards a large audience suggest an attempt to influence public opinion in a way that could affect electoral outcomes.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be considered.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Centrul FILIA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
