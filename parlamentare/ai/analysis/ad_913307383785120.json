This strongly suggests an attempt at electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are used by candidates and are mandated for electoral materials.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate by name or surname, the strong call to \"NU VOTA\u021aI O ILUZIE CREAT\u0102 DE INTELIGEN\u021a\u0102 ARTIFICIAL\u0102\" and the overall tone suggest an attempt to influence voters against a particular type of candidate or campaign strategy.  The presence of the CMF number further reinforces this suspicion.  The message is not directly naming a candidate, but it is clearly targeting a specific type of campaign, which could be interpreted as indirectly influencing the vote against candidates using AI-generated content in their campaigns. This is a grey area, and further investigation is needed to determine if this is a violation.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The use of hashtags further suggests an attempt to increase visibility and reach.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be influencing voters' choices. The repeated call not to vote for AI-generated illusions strongly suggests an attempt to sway public opinion against certain candidates or campaigns. The message is designed to create distrust and discourage voting for candidates perceived as using AI manipulation. This is a clear attempt to influence the vote, even if indirectly.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and presents a biased opinion, aiming to persuade rather than inform. While it uses a narrative structure, it's clearly designed as a persuasive piece of political communication, not a neutral news report.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>While the post is presented as a personal anecdote, its clear political message and call to action transcend a simple expression of personal opinion. The narrative serves as a vehicle to deliver a persuasive message against a specific type of campaign, making it electoral propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>913307383785120</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly naming a candidate, strongly suggests an attempt to influence voters against candidates using AI-generated content in their campaigns. The presence of a CMF number, the paid advertisement format, the wide reach, and the clear call to action (\"NU VOTA\u021aI\") all point towards electoral propaganda.  The argument that it's a personal opinion is weak, given the clear political intent and persuasive nature of the message.  The post aims to create distrust and discourage voting for a certain type of campaign, thus directly influencing the electoral outcome.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Unspecified - Candidates using AI-generated content</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAlexandru Rogobete, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 913307383785120) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul  \u201eNU VOTA\u021aI O ILUZIE CREAT\u0102 DE INTELIGEN\u021a\u0102 ARTIFICIAL\u0102!\u201d,  care, de\u0219i nu nume\u0219te explicit un candidat, are ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a votului \u00eempotriva candida\u021bilor care utilizeaz\u0103 con\u021binut generat de inteligen\u021b\u0103 artificial\u0103 \u00een campaniile lor.
