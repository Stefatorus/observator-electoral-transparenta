It refers to a specific candidate (Brian Cristian), is clearly intended for a wide audience (paid Facebook ad), has an explicit electoral objective (positive portrayal to influence votes), and does not adhere to journalistic standards. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as campaign material.  The post's timing (after the official campaign period) is also a crucial factor.  While the exact end date of the campaign is not specified, the context strongly suggests a violation if the post was published after the legal deadline.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR Maramures</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1244156820201582), cu con\u021binut electoral care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Brian Cristian, eviden\u021biind realiz\u0103rile sale legislative (277 ini\u021biative, 10 legi promulgate) \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 se informeze corect \u00eenainte de a-\u0219i alege parlamentarii.
