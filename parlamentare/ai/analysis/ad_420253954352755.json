The paid nature of the post, its broad reach via Facebook, and the use of hashtags directly related to the parliamentary elections strongly indicate an intention to influence voters.  The content, while not overtly directive, promotes a positive image and vision associated with the candidate.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the overall impression of electoral propaganda.  The fact that the post was published after the official end of the campaign period is a significant factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Diana Moraru</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FRP TV</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFederatia Romanilor de Pretutindeni, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei reclame pe Facebook (ID postare: 420253954352755), cu cheltuieli intre 300 si 399 RON, care promoveaza candidata Diana Moraru pentru un post in Cluj, folosind hashtag-uri precum #DianaMorarudeputat si #Alegeriparlamentare2024, avand ca efect electoral influentarea votului in favoarea acesteia.
