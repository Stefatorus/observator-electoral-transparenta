The overall tone and content are designed to persuade readers to support Georgescu.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>While the post presents some observations about the political climate and public sentiment, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting.

The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but the other elements overwhelmingly point towards a violation.  The post fulfills all the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The post's persuasive language and focus on influencing voting behavior outweigh the initial presentation of seemingly neutral observations.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>C\u01celin Georgescu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>USR Candidate (Unspecified)</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMircea Cirt, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 928392119243935) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul C\u01celin Georgescu \u0219i denigreaz\u0103 implicit un candidat USR, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin \u00eendemnul la vot pentru un anumit candidat.
