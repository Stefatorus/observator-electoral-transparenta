The call to action (\"s\\u0103 nu uita\\u021bi s\\u0103 \\u00eei taxa\\u021bi la vot!\") encourages voting, implicitly suggesting support for the party associated with the post. The hashtags are also clearly aimed at promoting Brian Cristian's candidacy.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>FALSE: While the post touches upon a newsworthy topic (alleged voting irregularities), its primary purpose is not objective reporting. The strong emotional language (\"manevr\\u0103 a sistemului corupt\"), the use of hashtags promoting a specific candidate, and the call to action strongly suggest an intention to influence voters beyond mere information dissemination.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>FALSE: The post presents allegations as facts, without providing evidence or context.  The emotional tone and the clear promotion of a candidate suggest it's not a neutral expression of personal opinion but rather a politically motivated statement aimed at swaying public opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1326594138703691</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.

The hashtags further amplify the promotional aspect.  The paid nature of the Facebook post confirms its intention to reach a wide audience.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Elena Lasconi</name><impact>POSITIVE (indirect)</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1326594138703691) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Brian Cristian \u0219i, indirect, pe cea a Elenei Lasconi,  prin utilizarea de hashtag-uri precum #briancristian, #briancristian2024, #briancristiandeputat, #elenalasconi \u0219i #lasconipre\u0219edinte,  \u0219i prin acuza\u021bii nefondate privind nereguli electorale, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
