It directly refers to a candidate (Brian Cristian), albeit implicitly, through highlighting his actions in Parliament and using the party affiliation in the byline. The post targets a wide audience via a paid Facebook campaign, and its clear objective is to influence voters by presenting the candidate in a positive light and encouraging them to vote for him. The post's content is promotional, not journalistic, lacking the objectivity required for neutral reporting. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral propaganda.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 890958233105596) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd \u00een vedere c\u0103 promoveaz\u0103 implicit candidatul Brian Cristian prin eviden\u021bierea activit\u0103\u021bii sale parlamentare \u0219i afilierea la USR, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
