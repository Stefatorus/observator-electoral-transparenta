This strongly suggests it is electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are mandated for campaign materials.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any parliamentary candidate by name or surname. However, the presence of the CMF number and the focus on political issues strongly suggest an indirect reference to a political entity, likely associated with the USR party given the contact information and website link.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The content is not a personal communication but aims for broader dissemination.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post presents a detailed political program with specific policy proposals. While not explicitly urging voters to vote for a specific candidate, the clear intention is to promote a political agenda and implicitly influence voters' choices in the upcoming elections. The detailed nature of the proposals and their alignment with a likely political party's platform strongly suggests an electoral objective.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and presents a partisan viewpoint, promoting a specific political agenda rather than providing neutral information or analysis.  The style is more akin to campaign rhetoric than journalistic reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content is not a personal opinion; it's a structured presentation of policy proposals, clearly intended to influence voters' perceptions and choices. The detailed nature of the proposals and their organization negate the possibility of it being a mere personal opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>2234871730229952</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe presence of a CMF number, the detailed policy proposals presented in a manner clearly intended to influence voters, the targeting of a specific region (Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County), and the use of a paid Facebook advertisement all strongly indicate that this post constitutes electoral propaganda.  While no specific candidate is named, the indirect association with the USR party through the contact information and website link is evident. The post's objective is to promote a political agenda and implicitly influence voters' choices.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak; the detailed nature of the proposals and their organization are not consistent with a personal opinion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Lorand Toth</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Reprezentant AVON], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 2234871730229952) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103,  con\u021bin\u00e2nd un program politic detaliat \u0219i un num\u0103r CMF (CMF:11240015),  av\u00e2nd drept scop influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea USR,  prin promovarea indirect\u0103 a candidatului Lorand Toth.
