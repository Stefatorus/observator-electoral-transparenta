It directly promotes specific candidates (ANC for Parliament and C\u01celin Georgescu for Presidency), targets a wide audience in Bucharest through a paid advertisement, and explicitly aims to influence voting behavior. The post's language and call to action leave no doubt about its electoral objective.  While the post does not contain a CMF number, this does not negate the fact that it is clearly electoral propaganda. The post's content fulfills all the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement further strengthens the case for it being electoral propaganda. The end date of the advertisement (1732953600) suggests it may have run after the official end of the electoral campaign, further compounding the violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>ANC</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>C\u01celin Georgescu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FreeInfo</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFreeInfo, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 435262922971000), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit candidatul ANC pentru Parlamentul Rom\u00e2niei \u0219i pe C\u01celin Georgescu pentru Pre\u0219edin\u021bia Rom\u00e2niei, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea acestora.
