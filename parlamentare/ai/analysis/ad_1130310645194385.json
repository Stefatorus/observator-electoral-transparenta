The post focuses on the combined voting power of this alliance and contrasts it with the voting power of other groups, including those who voted for C\u01celin Georgescu. This implicitly encourages voters to support candidates outside this alliance.

It lacks objectivity, presents biased information (e.g., the claim about the alliance's voting power and the implied criticism of UDMR), and its primary goal is not to inform but to persuade voters to act in a specific way.

The presence of a CMF number, the targeting of the Romanian population, the clear intention to influence the election outcome by highlighting the numerical advantage of a specific alliance and urging voters to act against it, and the lack of journalistic objectivity all point towards a violation of Article 98 t).
