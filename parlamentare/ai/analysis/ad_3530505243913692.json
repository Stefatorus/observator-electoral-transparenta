The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name, surname, or party affiliation.  It focuses on a broader political opinion survey.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, explicitly inviting participation from a wide audience (\"V\u0103 invit\u0103m s\u0103 ne acorda\u021bi c\u00e2teva minute pentru a ne ajuta s\u0103 \u00een\u021belegem mai bine opiniile dumneavoastr\u0103 politice\").</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True, but inconclusive. While the survey aims to understand political opinions, the direct intention to influence voting behavior is not explicitly stated. The link leads to a survey about electoral behavior, which could indirectly influence voting patterns by informing candidates about public opinion. However, this is not a direct call to vote for or against any candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post is not journalistic in nature. It's a survey invitation, not a news report, analysis, or opinion piece. While it touches upon political opinions, it lacks the objectivity and journalistic standards expected of news reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion unrelated to electoral influence. The survey's purpose is clearly to gather data related to political opinions, which could be used to influence electoral outcomes.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3530505243913692</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post presents a complex case. While it doesn't directly advocate for or against any candidate, the survey's focus on electoral behavior and the use of paid advertising on a public platform raise concerns. The potential for indirect influence on voting patterns exists, as the collected data could inform campaign strategies. However, the lack of explicit calls to vote for or against specific candidates weakens the case for a clear violation.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
