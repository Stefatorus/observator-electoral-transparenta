While the post presents itself as an analysis of C\u01celin Georgescu's electoral success, the title (\"7 major lessons for Romania after the C\u01celin typhoon swept the presidential elections\") and the overall tone suggest an attempt to influence public opinion. The framing of Georgescu as an \"extremist outsider\" could be interpreted as negatively influencing voters' perception of him.  The question \"How was it possible?\" at the end implicitly invites further discussion and potentially influences voters' choices. This fulfills \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post attempts to provide an analysis of a political event, resembling journalistic style. However, the subjective language (\"extremist outsider,\" \"typhoon\"), the focus on a single candidate's success, and the lack of balanced perspectives raise concerns about its objectivity. The overall tone leans towards opinion rather than neutral reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False.

The subjective language, biased framing, and focus on a single candidate, coupled with the wide reach of the paid advertisement, suggest an intention to influence voters' perceptions and choices.  Although it doesn't explicitly endorse or discourage voting for Georgescu, the negative framing (\"extremist outsider\") and the overall tone could negatively impact his image. The post's reach (over 1 million) and the money spent (RON 100-199) further strengthen the argument that it is electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number is not a decisive factor, as the post's content and context strongly suggest its propagandistic nature.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>C\u01celin Georgescu</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>NEWBIZ ONLINE PUBLISHING S.R.L.</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nNEWBIZ ONLINE PUBLISHING S.R.L., pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1288484149018085) cu con\u021binut propagandistic electoral, care prezint\u0103 o analiz\u0103 subiectiv\u0103 \u0219i tenden\u021bioas\u0103 a succesului electoral al candidatului C\u01celin Georgescu, utiliz\u00e2nd termeni precum \u201eoutsider extremist\u201d \u0219i \u201etaifun\u201d, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba negativ percep\u021bia publicului asupra acestuia.
