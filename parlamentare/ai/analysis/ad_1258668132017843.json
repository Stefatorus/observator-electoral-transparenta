It refers to specific candidates (through the image), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has a clear electoral objective of encouraging votes for the REPER party. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing is also crucial; even if the general election period has ended, the specific date mentioned (December 1st) suggests it might be related to a second round or a different election still ongoing.  There are no counterarguments to suggest this is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>MOLEAVIN ADRIAN</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>DOGARU GEORGETA</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1258668132017843) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \u201eD\u00e2mbovi\u021ba voteaz\u0103 REPER pe 1 decembrie!\u201d, care promoveaz\u0103 \u00een mod direct candida\u021bii Moleavin Adrian \u0219i Dogaru Georgeta pentru Senat, din partea partidului REPER, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestora.
