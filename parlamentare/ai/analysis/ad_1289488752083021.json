The post explicitly instructs voters to select position 10 on the ballot, directly advocating for a specific party.  The use of a unique identification code, targeted advertising in Maramure\u0219 County, and the clear call to action (\"Voteaz\u0103 pozi\u021bia 10,\" \"SUS\u021aINE PARTIDUL REPER\") all strongly suggest this is electoral propaganda. The post's objective is to influence voters' choices in the election, fulfilling all criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The post's end date (1732953600) corresponds to December 1st, 2024, suggesting it was active after the official end of the electoral campaign period, further strengthening the case for a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Partidul REPER</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAtelierul de internet SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 1289488752083021) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul REPER pentru alegerile parlamentare din 1 Decembrie 2024, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd direct aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 voteze pozi\u021bia 10 pe buletinul de vot.
