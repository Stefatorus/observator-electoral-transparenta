While the post doesn't explicitly urge people to vote for Alfred Laurentiu Mihai, the act of promoting a candidate's profile on Facebook during the electoral period strongly suggests an electoral objective.

While not explicitly urging voters to vote for him, the post's design, targeting, and paid nature strongly suggest an intention to influence the election. The image used further enhances his image and credibility.  The post's content and context align with the definition of electoral propaganda under Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement targeting a wide audience (>1M reach) further strengthens this conclusion.  The only argument against it being propaganda is the lack of an explicit call to vote, but the implicit message is clear.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Alfred Laurentiu Mihai</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAlfred Laurentiu Mihai, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 789982992533253), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 imaginea \u0219i profilul s\u0103u ca senator PSD din jude\u021bul Ilfov, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv prin cre\u0219terea vizibilit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i a credibilit\u0103\u021bii sale \u00een r\u00e2ndul aleg\u0103torilor.
