The content is purely informational, announcing dates, times, and locations of public events. There is no mention of any political party, candidate, or any attempt to influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections. The post does not meet the criteria of electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically make it electoral propaganda; the content itself must be analyzed. In this case, the content is clearly non-political and focused on community engagement.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Prim\\u0103ria Vi\\u0219eu de Sus</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
