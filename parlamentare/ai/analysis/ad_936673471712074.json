While not explicitly advocating for a specific candidate, the post's clear intention is to negatively influence voters' perception of the coalition, thereby indirectly promoting AUR. The post's timing, close to the election, further strengthens this interpretation. The use of strong language (\"toxic coalition,\" \"false defenders of democracy\") and the call for voters to \"present themselves at the ballot box for a sovereign Romania\" are persuasive techniques typical of electoral propaganda.  The image shows a gathering of AUR supporters, reinforcing the political message.  The post's reach (35K-40K impressions) and spend (RON600-RON699) indicate a significant effort to influence public opinion.  While the post doesn't directly mention specific candidates, the indirect impact on the election is undeniable.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>AUR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAUR - S\u0103laj de Sus, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 936673471712074), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu un buget de RON600-RON699, care atinge 35K-40K impresii,  con\u021bin\u00e2nd critici vehemente la adresa coali\u021biei PSD-PNL-USR, asociind ac\u021biunile acestora cu alegerile parlamentare \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd implicit la vot \u00eempotriva lor, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar \u00een favoarea AUR.
