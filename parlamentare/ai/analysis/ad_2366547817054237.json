The post invites participation in a survey about political opinions, a goal that does not directly aim to influence voting behavior for any specific candidate. The lack of explicit or implicit endorsement of any candidate, combined with the survey's focus on general political opinions, distinguishes it from prohibited electoral propaganda.  The post's design and language are neutral, lacking the persuasive elements typically associated with electoral campaigning.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
