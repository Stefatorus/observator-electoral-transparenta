While the post is clearly related to the Romanian parliamentary elections and targets the Hungarian minority, it does not explicitly mention any specific candidate by name or surname.  The post promotes voting for the RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania) party, but doesn't single out individual candidates.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, specifically the Hungarian-speaking population of Romania. The targeting parameters further support this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage members of the Hungarian minority in Romania to vote for the RMDSZ in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The phrasing (\"December 1-j\u00e9n a magyarok nem vesz\u00edthetnek,\" which translates to \"On December 1st, Hungarians cannot lose\") and the call to action (\"SZAVAZZ TE IS!\" or \"VOTE YOU TOO!\") directly aim to influence voting behavior.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It presents a partisan viewpoint, urging voters to support a specific political party, and uses emotionally charged language (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\" or \"We are in danger!\") to sway public opinion.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The content transcends personal opinion; it's a political advertisement with a clear call to action designed to influence electoral outcomes.  The language used is not simply expressing an opinion but actively campaigning for a party.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1090345325891072</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by RMDSZ, constitutes electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't name specific candidates, it directly promotes the RMDSZ party during the election period, using emotionally charged language and a clear call to action to influence voters. The targeting of specific regions with significant Hungarian populations further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's design and messaging are consistent with the definition of electoral propaganda under Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement on a public platform ensures it reaches a wide audience, fulfilling the criteria of addressing the public. The post's objective is clearly to increase votes for RMDSZ.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1090345325891072), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd \u00een vedere con\u021binutul s\u0103u explicit de \u00eendemn la vot pentru RMDSZ, utilizarea unui limbaj emo\u021bional (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\") \u0219i un apel direct la ac\u021biune (\"SZAVAZZ TE IS!\").
