It encourages voting in general terms.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just specific individuals. The targeting parameters further support this, indicating a broad geographical reach across multiple counties in Romania.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Partially True. While the post encourages voting, it doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any specific candidate or party. The call to action is general (\"Vote because you matter!\"), aiming to increase voter turnout rather than swaying votes towards a particular option.  This makes the electoral objective less direct than in typical electoral propaganda.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the characteristics of journalistic reporting. It doesn't present factual information, analysis, or diverse perspectives. Instead, it promotes a general message encouraging participation in the electoral process.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express a personal opinion; it promotes a civic duty message. While the phrasing is persuasive, it avoids explicitly endorsing any political stance.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>957927339511717</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while promoting participation in the elections, does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 98 t) and Article 36 (7) of the relevant laws.  It lacks explicit endorsement of any candidate or party. The call to vote is general and aims to increase voter turnout, not to influence the vote in favor of a specific candidate.  The targeting is broad, covering multiple counties, suggesting a general civic engagement message rather than a targeted campaign. While the post's persuasive language might be considered borderline, in dubio pro reo, it does not clearly violate the law.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>KMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
