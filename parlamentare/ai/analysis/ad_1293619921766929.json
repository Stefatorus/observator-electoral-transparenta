This is a general policy matter, not directly related to the parliamentary elections. The post is informational, citing a government source, and does not advocate for or against any specific candidate or party.  While energy policy is a political issue, this post's primary purpose is to inform, not to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections.  The lack of any reference to specific candidates or parties, combined with the informational nature of the content, suggests that it does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Romania Eficienta</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
