It refers directly to a specific candidate (George Grasu), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual legal end date for the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Grasu), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The post's content is not journalistic in nature; it is explicitly promotional.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>George Grasu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>SOS</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSC Columna Film Studio SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1114646240320099) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit candidatul George Grasu pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea Partidului SOS Rom\u00e2nia, Filiala D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, indic\u00e2ndu-i pozi\u021bia pe buletinul de vot (pozi\u021bia 8).
