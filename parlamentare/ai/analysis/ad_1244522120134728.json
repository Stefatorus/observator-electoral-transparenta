While the mayor's image is used, the content is entirely non-political in nature, focusing on national unity and celebration. There is no mention of any parliamentary candidate or party, nor any call to action related to voting. The post does not meet the criteria of electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The paid promotion is for a message unrelated to the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Moldova Invest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
