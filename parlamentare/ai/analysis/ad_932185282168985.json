It refers directly to a candidate (REPER), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook campaign, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support REPER. The post's content, including the call to vote \"with confidence, not with fear,\" and the prominent display of the party's ballot position, strongly suggests an intention to sway public opinion.  The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  While the post doesn't explicitly mention advising voters at polling stations, its clear intent to promote REPER during the election period makes it electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>REPER</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER Bra\u0219ov, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 932185282168985) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea partidului REPER.
