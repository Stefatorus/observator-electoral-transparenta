The content aims to positively portray Teodor Lazar and implicitly criticize his opponents. The argument against it being propaganda is weak, as the post lacks journalistic objectivity and is clearly designed for political campaigning.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Elena Lasconi</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Teodor Lazar</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTeodor Laz\u0103r, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1508451479867376) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103,  men\u021bion\u00e2nd explicit \"#ElenaLasconi\" \u00eentr-un context negativ \u0219i promov\u00e2ndu-l pe Teodor Laz\u0103r \u00eentr-un mod pozitiv, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
