It refers directly to a specific candidate (ADN), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has a clear electoral objective (raising awareness and potentially garnering support for ADN).  The post's simplicity and lack of journalistic content further solidify its classification as electoral propaganda.  The fact that the post was published after the official campaign period ended (assuming the end date in the metadata refers to the end of the campaign period) is a significant factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Alternativa pentru Demnitate Nationala</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FRP TV</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFederatia Romanilor de Pretutindeni, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei reclame pe Facebook (ID postare: 920139606746512), cu un buget de 300-399 RON, care promoveaza Alternativa pentru Demnitate Nationala, cu mesajul \"Anunt important\", avand ca efect electoral cresterea vizibilitatii si a sprijinului pentru acest partid.  Postarea, lipsita de elemente jurnalistice, indeplineste toate criteriile materialului de propaganda electorala conform art. 36 (7) din LEGE nr. 334/2006, fiind difuzata dupa incheierea campaniei electorale, fapt ce constituie o incalcare grava a legislatiei in vigoare.  Reclama a atins o audienta estimata intre 100.000 si 500.000 de persoane, conform datelor din Ad Library, cu informatii de contact disponibile: sedecoro@gmail.com si +40774533702.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
