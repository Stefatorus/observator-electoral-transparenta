It refers directly to a candidate (Elena Lasconi), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the exact dates are not specified in the provided data, the context suggests it's within the campaign period), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Lasconi), and goes beyond journalistic reporting by being a direct endorsement. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement on a public platform amplifies its reach and impact.  The counter-argument could be that the post discusses the Moldovan elections, but the clear call to action to vote for Lasconi in the Romanian presidential election overrides this.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Elena Lasconi</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTeodor Laz\u0103r, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 8547083375402612) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103.
