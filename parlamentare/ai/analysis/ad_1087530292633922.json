While the post advocates for change and criticizes established parties, it does not explicitly mention or refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or clearly identifiable affiliation.  The hashtags used are general in nature (#AlegeriParlamentare, #VotulTauConteaza, #SchimbareReala, #PentruRomaniaTa) and do not single out a specific candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language used (\"E timpul pentru schimbare!\", \"Rom\u00e2nia are nevoie de oameni noi\", \"Ie\u0219i la vot\") is clearly aimed at a broad segment of the population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Partially True. The post encourages voting and implies a need for change, which could indirectly influence voters' choices. However, it lacks direct endorsements or calls to vote for a specific candidate or party. The call to vote for \"oameni care s\u0103 se lupte pentru adev\u0103r \u0219i dreptate\" is too vague to be considered a direct electoral objective targeting a specific candidate. The overall message promotes a general idea of change and better governance, rather than promoting a specific candidate or party.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents a critique of established parties, which could be considered a form of political commentary. However, it crosses the line into advocacy by explicitly urging voters to participate and implicitly suggesting that the current system needs reform. The line between commentary and advocacy is blurred here.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses opinions about the political landscape, it's presented in a manner clearly intended to influence voters' behavior, going beyond a simple expression of personal views.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1087530292633922</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post promotes a general message advocating for change and better governance, without explicitly endorsing any specific candidate or party. While it encourages voting and criticizes established parties, the connection to a particular candidate is too tenuous to definitively classify it as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The lack of specific candidate mention and the general nature of the call to vote weigh against a finding of violation. However, the paid nature of the post and its clear intention to influence public opinion regarding the need for change in the political system are factors that could be interpreted as indirect electoral propaganda.  The ambiguity of the message makes a definitive classification challenging.  In dubio pro reo, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the advertiser.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
