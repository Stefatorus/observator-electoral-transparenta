The engine of Botosani County! #continu\u0103mSchimbarea\") aims to promote the PNL's positive impact on agriculture in Botosani. This is clearly intended to influence voters to support the PNL in the upcoming elections.

The post's objective is to positively associate the PNL with agricultural progress in Botosani, thereby encouraging voters to support them.  The presence of the CMF number, the targeting data, and the explicitly promotional nature of the message all point towards a violation.  There are no counterarguments to suggest otherwise.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>All PNL candidates in Botosani</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPNL Botosani - Organizatia Municipala, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu ID-ul 1517892218924770, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024,  cu mesajul \"Agricultura.
