While the advertiser is a political party, the content itself is not electoral propaganda. It lacks any direct or indirect reference to specific candidates or calls to action related to voting. The hashtags used are generic and do not constitute an attempt to influence the vote. The timing of the post (March 8th, International Women's Day) further supports the conclusion that the post's primary purpose is not related to the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
