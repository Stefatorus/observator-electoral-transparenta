It directly encourages voters to vote for the PSD, fulfilling all criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post's timing (after the official campaign period, according to the provided `end_date`), its targeting of a specific geographical area (Vrancea County), and its explicit call to action (\"Te a\u0219tept\u0103m pe 1 decembrie la vot!\") strongly suggest an intention to influence the election results.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement further strengthens this conclusion.  While it doesn't mention specific candidates, the association with the PSD is undeniable and the impact is clearly positive for the party.  The absence of a CMF number, while not definitive, adds to the suspicion of potential non-compliance.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul Social Democrat (PSD)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Social Democrat - Filiala Vrancea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 1723851535114433), cu mesajul explicit \u201eTe a\u0219tept\u0103m pe 1 decembrie la vot!\u201d,  care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru Partidul Social Democrat, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv pentru PSD.
