The primary objective seems to be encouraging voter turnout, not promoting a specific candidate. However, indirectly, increased voter turnout could benefit any candidate. The line between encouraging participation and influencing the vote is blurred here.  The post's timing (close to election day) is a significant factor.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse a specific candidate, its timing (close to election day) and the clear intention to boost voter turnout could be interpreted as indirectly influencing the election.  The lack of explicit candidate mention makes a definitive conclusion difficult.  However, the overall message and context suggest a potential violation, especially considering the paid nature of the Facebook post and its broad reach.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied cautiously here, as the potential for electoral influence is present.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Kovacs Mih\u00e1ly Levente</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nKovacs Mih\u00e1ly Levente, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 518887677800234), cu mesajul \"Ha Magyari Albert 96 \u00e9vesen is elmegy szavazni, akkor vas\u00e1rnap neked is a szavaz\u00f3f\u00fclk\u00e9ben a helyed!\", care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, are un efect electoral indirect prin \u00eencurajarea particip\u0103rii la vot, apropiindu-se de ziua alegerilor.
