However, the context strongly suggests he is running for office, given the call to vote for him on December 1st and the mention of representing the Hungarian minority.  This aligns with \"Article 36 (7) - a\" if he is indeed a candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The use of both Romanian and Hungarian languages further broadens its potential reach.

The phrases \"Vas\u00e1rnap t\u00e1mogassanak minket szavazatukkal\" (Sunday support us with your vote) and \"Duminic\u0103 sprijini\u021bi-ne cu votul dumneavoastr\u0103\" (Sunday support us with your vote) clearly aim to influence voting behavior.

While it expresses a viewpoint, its core purpose is not merely to share an opinion but to actively solicit votes for a particular candidate.

The call to vote for him, coupled with the advertisement's broad reach and lack of journalistic neutrality, strongly suggests it constitutes electoral propaganda.  While it lacks a CMF number, the context makes it highly probable that this is a violation. The post's bilingual nature (Romanian and Hungarian) indicates an attempt to reach a specific demographic within the electorate. The spending of RON 400-499 further emphasizes the intention to influence voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Moln\u00e1r Andr\u00e1s</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Trendmakers</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTrendmakers, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 907338324823558), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Moln\u00e1r Andr\u00e1s prin \u00eendemnuri directe la vot (\"Vas\u00e1rnap t\u00e1mogassanak minket szavazatukkal\", \"Duminic\u0103 sprijini\u021bi-ne cu votul dumneavoastr\u0103\"), av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin influen\u021barea votan\u021bilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
