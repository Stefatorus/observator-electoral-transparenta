There is no CMF number present in the provided post.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions Ludovic Orban, a member of the For\u021ba Dreptei party. However, the reference is within a narrative about an internal party conflict and does not explicitly endorse or oppose him in the context of the parliamentary elections.  The post also mentions Liviu Petrina, but again, in the context of an internal party dispute, not the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a public Facebook post, paid for and intended to reach a wide audience.  The reach estimate is \">1M\", indicating a broad dissemination.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be to express Valerian Stan's grievances regarding internal party matters within PN\u021aMM. While Ludovic Orban is mentioned, the focus is on a personal conflict and not on influencing voters' choices in the parliamentary elections. There is no explicit call to vote for or against any candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of citizen journalism, where Valerian Stan is recounting his perspective on events within his party.  It presents a narrative, but it does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity and fact-checking. However, the lack of clear electoral intent weakens the argument for it being electoral propaganda.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post primarily expresses Valerian Stan's personal opinions and grievances regarding internal party conflicts. While it mentions political figures, the context is personal and not aimed at influencing the parliamentary elections.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>751521740517043</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post primarily focuses on an internal conflict within PN\u021aMM and does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. While it mentions Ludovic Orban and Liviu Petrina, the context is one of personal conflict and internal party disputes, not electoral campaigning. The lack of a CMF number, combined with the absence of explicit calls to vote for or against any candidate, suggests that this post does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The fact that the post is paid for does not automatically make it electoral propaganda; the content itself must meet the criteria defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  This post does not clearly meet all the criteria.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Ludovic Orban</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Liviu Petrina</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Valerian Stan</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
