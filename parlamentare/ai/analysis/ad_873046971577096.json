This makes it impossible to determine if it constitutes electoral propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number and the lack of any identifiable reference to a candidate or party lean towards a conclusion that it is not electoral propaganda. However, the paid nature of the post and its targeting of a wide audience are factors that could suggest otherwise if the content were decipherable.  Given the uncertainty due to the unintelligible text, the principle of \"in dubio pro reo\" should be applied.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Costel Fotea</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
