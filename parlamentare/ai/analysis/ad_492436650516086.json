While not explicitly advocating for or against specific candidates, it implicitly suggests a need for change and better leadership. This could be interpreted as having an electoral objective, aiming to influence voters' choices by highlighting dissatisfaction with the current political landscape.  This is a strong argument for Article 36 (7) - c applying.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post presents itself as an analysis of the political climate, focusing on the impact of the anti-system vote. However, the lack of specific factual claims, the use of general statements, and the overall tone suggest it's less journalistic and more opinion-based, potentially intended to sway public opinion rather than objectively inform.  The line between journalism and propaganda is blurred here.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a purely personal opinion. It presents a broader analysis of the political situation, but with a clear bias towards the need for change, which could be interpreted as an attempt to influence voters' choices.

The targeting data shows a wide reach within Teleorman County.  The lack of a CMF number is not definitive, but the overall context strongly suggests an attempt to influence the election, even indirectly.  The argument against is that the post doesn't directly mention any candidate. However, the indirect influence on voter behavior is significant.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Total Impact</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTotal Impact, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 492436650516086), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu un buget sub 100 RON, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit candida\u021bi, analizeaz\u0103 contextul politic actual \u0219i sugereaz\u0103 indirect necesitatea schimb\u0103rii, influen\u021b\u00e2nd astfel op\u021biunile electorale ale cet\u0103\u021benilor din jude\u021bul Teleorman.
