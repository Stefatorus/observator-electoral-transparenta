This, coupled with the paid advertisement format on a public platform and the use of election-related hashtags, strongly suggests an intention to influence voters. The post fulfills the criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, indicating it is electoral propaganda.  The fact that the ad ran after the official campaign period ended (end_date: 1732867200, which corresponds to November 23rd, 2024) is a key factor.  The ad's targeting parameters (age, location) further suggest a deliberate attempt to reach potential voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin difuzarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 874335204687626, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Manolache Vasile la alegerile parlamentare, prezent\u00e2ndu-l \u00eentr-o lumin\u0103 pozitiv\u0103 \u0219i f\u0103c\u00e2nd promisiuni electorale, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
