However, it doesn't explicitly state he's running for a parliamentary seat. The hashtags #PNRR and  #sanatatepentruoameni suggest a focus on healthcare and the PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan), which are not directly tied to a specific parliamentary election.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The use of hashtags further amplifies its potential reach beyond a personal circle.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post seems to be promoting Alexandru Rogobete and his work related to healthcare and the PNRR. While it could indirectly influence voters' perception of him, the content doesn't explicitly urge people to vote for him in the parliamentary elections. The connection to the parliamentary elections is tenuous at best.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post's style is more promotional than journalistic.

While it could indirectly influence public opinion, it doesn't explicitly advocate for voting for him in the parliamentary elections. The hashtags used are related to his work and not directly to the parliamentary campaign. The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being direct electoral propaganda.  The content is more akin to self-promotion than direct electoral campaigning.  While the post is paid for and targets a wide audience, the lack of a direct call to vote and the focus on non-election related activities makes it borderline.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards it not being electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
