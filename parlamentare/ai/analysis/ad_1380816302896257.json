It refers to a specific candidate (Victoria Stoiciu), is used during the electoral campaign period (judging by the dates provided), has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement.  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to negate these factors.  The post's promotional nature and focus on a candidate's attributes outweigh any potential argument for it being journalistic or a personal opinion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Victoria Stoiciu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nBun\u0103 ziua Vaslui, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 1380816302896257), care promoveaz\u0103 candidata PSD Victoria Stoiciu la func\u021bia de senator \u00een Vaslui, cu un efect electoral pozitiv, prin prezentarea acesteia ca \u201einvitata noastr\u0103 special\u0103\u201d \u0219i eviden\u021bierea rolului s\u0103u de consilier de stat \u0219i candidat\u0103 PSD.
