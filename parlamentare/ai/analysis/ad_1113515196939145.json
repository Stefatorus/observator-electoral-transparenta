This strongly suggests electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are mandatory for electoral campaign materials in Romania.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>TRUE: The post explicitly mentions \"Brian Cristian,\" a candidate, and uses hashtags like #briancristian2024 and #briancristiandeputat, directly linking the content to his candidacy for parliamentary elections.  It also mentions Elena Lasconi, who is a candidate for president, but this is not the election being discussed. The post also mentions USR, his political party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>TRUE: This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed for wide public reach. The hashtags and general message are not targeted at specific individuals but aim for broader engagement.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>TRUE: The core message urges voters to \"choose people who work for you\" and implies that Brian Cristian is such a person.  The phrases \"Alege\u021bi oameni care muncesc pentru voi\" and \"s\u0103 avem o Rom\u00e2nie pentru to\u021bi, nu doar pentru unii!\" directly aim to influence voting behavior in favor of the candidate. The use of hashtags further amplifies this objective.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>FALSE: While the post mentions parliamentary activity (\"cele mai multe \u00eentreb\u0103ri \u0219i interpel\u0103ri \u00een Parlament\"), it does not present this information in a neutral, journalistic manner. The presentation is clearly biased, promoting the candidate's actions as positive and implicitly urging voters to support him.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>FALSE: The post transcends personal opinion; it's a carefully crafted message designed to promote a candidate and influence electoral choices. The language used is not merely expressive but actively persuasive.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1113515196939145</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It refers directly to a candidate (Brian Cristian), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual Romanian parliamentary election dates to confirm if it's after the official end), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Brian Cristian), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by actively promoting the candidate. The presence of a CMF number further solidifies its nature as electoral propaganda.  The targeting of the ad (age, location) also suggests an attempt to maximize its impact on voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1113515196939145) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru Brian Cristian, candidat USR la alegerile parlamentare.
