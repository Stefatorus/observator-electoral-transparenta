It directly promotes RMDSZ, a political party participating in the parliamentary elections, by emphasizing the need for their strong representation and highlighting their plans for community development if they participate in the government coalition. The post's paid nature on a public platform, its broad geographical targeting, and its persuasive language all point towards an intention to influence voters' choices.  The post's content goes beyond simply informing the public; it actively advocates for a specific political party.  The absence of a CMF number, while not a definitive indicator of illegality, further suggests a lack of transparency.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vincze Lor\u00e1nt</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVincze Lor\u00e1nt, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 557108376952221) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 direct RMDSZ, un partid politic participant la alegerile parlamentare.
