The absence of a CMF number does not automatically exclude the possibility of electoral propaganda, but it is a factor to consider.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The image's text is in Hungarian, urging Hungarian voters in Romania to vote in the parliamentary elections. While it doesn't name specific candidates, the clear call to action (\"SZAVAZZ TE IS!\") directly relates to the parliamentary elections and implicitly promotes a particular political outcome favorable to the Hungarian minority's interests in Romania. This strongly suggests that \"Article 36 (7) - a\" applies, even without explicitly naming a candidate. The context is crucial here; the RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania) is a political party, and this post is clearly intended to mobilize their voters.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post, being a paid advertisement on Facebook, is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just a select few.  The targeting data shows a broad geographical reach across multiple counties in Romania, indicating an attempt to reach a large segment of the population. This fulfills the \"Article 36 (7) - c\" requirement.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to encourage Hungarian voters in Romania to participate in the parliamentary elections. The message emphasizes the importance of voting to protect the interests of the Hungarian community.  The phrasing \"December 1-j\u00e9n a magyarok nem vesz\u00edthetnek\" (\"On December 1st, Hungarians cannot lose\") is a strong call to action with a clear electoral objective. This directly satisfies \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic in nature. It lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. Instead, it presents a partisan viewpoint, urging voters to support a specific political outcome. It is not providing information about the electoral process but rather advocating for a particular party's success.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; it is a clear and direct appeal for voters to support a specific political agenda (the Hungarian minority's interests in Romania). The language used is not that of personal expression but of political mobilization.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>583730777346361</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by RMDSZ, is a clear form of electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't explicitly mention specific candidates, its call to action directly targets the parliamentary elections and promotes a political outcome favorable to the RMDSZ. The targeting data shows a broad geographical reach, indicating an attempt to influence a large number of voters. The message is not journalistic or neutral; it is a partisan appeal for votes. The post's objective is clearly to increase voter turnout among the Hungarian community in Romania, thus influencing the election results.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 583730777346361), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"December 1-j\u00e9n a magyarok nem vesz\u00edthetnek\", care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru partidul RMDSZ, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar pozitiv pentru acest partid, prin mobilizarea electoratului maghiar din Rom\u00e2nia.
