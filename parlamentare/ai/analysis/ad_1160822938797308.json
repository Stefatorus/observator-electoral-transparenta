This creates a positive association with his candidacy and indirectly promotes his electoral prospects. The targeting of specific demographics in Bistrita-Nasaud County further strengthens the argument that this is electoral propaganda.  The post's timing (after the official campaign period) is a crucial factor.  While the post doesn't directly instruct voters to vote for or against a candidate at a polling station, its indirect influence on voter turnout, coupled with its association with a candidate's page and paid promotion, makes it highly likely to be considered electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 explicit la votarea lui Manolache Vasile, creeaz\u0103 o asociere pozitiv\u0103 cu candidatura sa prin utilizarea numelui \u0219i imaginii sale \u00eentr-un mesaj care \u00eencurajeaz\u0103 participarea la vot.
