There is no CMF number present in the provided post.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any specific candidate by name or surname. However, it strongly implies support for the UDMR (Uniunea Democrat\u0103 Maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia) by using their logo and being posted from their official page.  The message promotes voting for pro-European representatives, implicitly contrasting with extremist parties. This could be interpreted as indirectly referring to UDMR candidates, as they align with the pro-European stance.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended for a wide audience, not just a select group of individuals. The use of Romanian and Hungarian languages further broadens its reach.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be influencing voters to support pro-European candidates in the parliamentary elections. The call to action (\"Pe 1 decembrie, sprijini\u021bi-ne cu votul dumneavoastr\u0103\") directly encourages voting for the party associated with the post (UDMR). While not explicitly naming candidates, the implicit endorsement is clear.  The contrast drawn with extremist parties further strengthens this objective.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected from journalistic reporting. Instead, it promotes a specific political viewpoint and encourages voters to support a particular party.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; it presents a partisan political message aimed at swaying public opinion in favor of the UDMR and pro-European candidates.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1118190939907017</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly naming candidates, strongly promotes the UDMR and implicitly encourages voters to support them in the parliamentary elections. The call to action, the use of the party's logo, and the contrasting of pro-European candidates with extremist parties all point towards an electoral objective. The timing of the post, close to the election day, further strengthens this interpretation.  While it doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) - a by not naming candidates, it strongly implies support for UDMR candidates, fulfilling the criteria of Article 36 (7) - b, c, and d.  The argument against it being propaganda could be that it doesn't explicitly name candidates, but the implicit endorsement is too strong to ignore.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>UDMR Candidates</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTemes Megyei RMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1118190939907017), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 implicit candida\u021bii UDMR la alegerile parlamentare printr-un mesaj care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru reprezentan\u021bi pro-europeni, contrast\u00e2nd cu partidele extremiste.
