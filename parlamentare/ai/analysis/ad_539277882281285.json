It refers to a specific candidate (Valeriu Iftime), is published during the electoral period (although the end date is given as 1732953600, which needs to be checked against the actual election date to confirm if it's after the official end of the campaign), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters in favor of Valeriu Iftime and the PNL. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument that it's from a news outlet is weak, as the content is promotional, not journalistic.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 539277882281285) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Valeriu Iftime de la PNL,  \u00een mod evident, prin prezentarea sa \u00eentr-o lumin\u0103 pozitiv\u0103 \u0219i prin asocierea sa cu valori tradi\u021bionale,  cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
