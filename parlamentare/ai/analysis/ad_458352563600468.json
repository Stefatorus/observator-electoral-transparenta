The post explicitly mentions Alexandru Muraru, who is identified as the president of PNL Ia\u0219i.  While not directly a parliamentary candidate, his role within the PNL, a party participating in the parliamentary elections, creates a strong link. The post also mentions Florin Alexe, a PNL deputy.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed for wide public reach. The link provided in the post also suggests a news article intended for public consumption.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While framed as a news article, the post focuses on the financial aspects of Alexandru Muraru's campaign, potentially influencing public perception of his candidacy and the PNL's campaign strategy. The negative framing of Muraru's electoral performance could indirectly discourage votes for him and the PNL.  The mention of loans from individuals with political connections raises questions about transparency and potentially undermines public trust in the party.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information in a journalistic style, including a link to a news article. However, the selective focus on Muraru's financial struggles and the critical tone suggest a potential bias beyond objective reporting.

The negative framing and focus on loans from individuals with political connections raise concerns about the post's objectivity and its potential to sway public opinion against Muraru and the PNL.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement on a public platform further strengthens the argument that it's intended to influence the election.  While it doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for or against a candidate, the implicit negative message could be considered electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Alexandru Muraru</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Florin Alexe</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Moldova Invest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMoldova Invest, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 458352563600468) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i prezentat\u0103 sub forma unui articol de \u0219tiri, con\u021bine informa\u021bii despre finan\u021barea campaniei lui Alexandru Muraru, pre\u0219edintele PNL Ia\u0219i, \u0219i a deputatului PNL Florin Alexe, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba negativ percep\u021bia publicului asupra acestora \u0219i a PNL.
