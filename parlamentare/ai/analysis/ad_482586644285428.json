The post's content, targeting, and explicit call to action (\"vote for PRA\") strongly suggest it's electoral propaganda.  The post's timing (after the official campaign period) is a crucial factor.  While the post doesn't explicitly mention the end of the campaign period, the fact that it's a paid advertisement promoting a candidate during a period when such promotion might be restricted raises serious concerns.  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the argument that this is not electoral propaganda.  The reach of the post (50K-60K impressions, 100K-500K reach estimate) amplifies its potential impact.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Geoan\u0103</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PRA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Rom\\u00e2nia \\u00een Ac\\u021biune Mehedin\u021bi, prin postarea pl\u0103tit\u0103 cu ID-ul 482586644285428, difuzat\u0103 pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, \u00eencalc\u0103 articolul 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin promovarea implicit\u0103 a candidatului Mircea Geoan\u0103 \u0219i a Partidului Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune (PRA) la alegerile parlamentare, dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei de campanie electoral\u0103.
