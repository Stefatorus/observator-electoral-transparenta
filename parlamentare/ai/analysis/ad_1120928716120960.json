While it doesn't explicitly call for votes, the association with a PSD deputy and the link to her official parliamentary profile strongly suggests an intention to enhance her public image and indirectly influence voters' perception of her.

The targeting of a large audience in Ialomi\u021ba County, combined with the link to her official profile, strongly suggests an intention to influence voters' perception and indirectly promote her candidacy.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but the overall context points towards electoral propaganda.  The end date of the ad (1732867200) needs to be checked against the official end date of the electoral campaign to determine if it violates the timeframe specified in Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>RALUCA GIORGIANA DUMITRESCU</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRaluca Giorgiana Dumitrescu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1120928716120960, care promoveaz\u0103 imaginea sa pozitiv\u0103 ca deputat PSD \u00een jude\u021bul Ialomi\u021ba, av\u00e2nd un buget de sub 100 RON,  ajung\u00e2nd la 25.000-30.000 de impresii, cu o estimare a audien\u021bei de 100.000-500.000 de persoane,  \u0219i un link c\u0103tre profilul s\u0103u oficial de pe site-ul Camerei Deputa\u021bilor,  av\u00e2nd drept efect electoral influen\u021barea percep\u021biei electoratului asupra candidaturii sale.
