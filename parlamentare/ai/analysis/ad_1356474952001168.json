It directly refers to a candidate (\u0218andor Ovidiu), is used during the electoral campaign period (judging by the hashtags and context), has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral propaganda.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform like Facebook reinforces its intention to reach a wide audience.  The mention of Mircea Geoan\u0103, while not explicitly endorsing, implicitly links the candidate to a known figure within the party, further enhancing the propaganda effect.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>\u0218andor Ovidiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PRA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Rom\u00e2nIa \u00een Ac\u021biune Mehedin\u021bi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1356474952001168) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura domnului \u0218andor Ovidiu pentru func\u021bia de senator.
