There is no CMF number present in the provided post information.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"Marcel\", which could refer to a political figure, but doesn't explicitly name a parliamentary candidate.  The context suggests a negative sentiment towards this individual, but without clear identification, it's difficult to definitively link it to a specific candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  Article 36 (7) - a does not clearly apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, targeting a wide audience within Cara\u0219-Severin County, Romania.  The reach estimate is 100K-500K, indicating a broad dissemination intended to reach more than just a few individuals. This fulfills the criteria of addressing the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The objective is unclear. While the post expresses a negative opinion about someone named \"Marcel,\" it doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any specific parliamentary candidate. The connection to the parliamentary elections is tenuous at best.  The primary goal seems to be expressing dissatisfaction, not influencing votes directly. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c is likely not applicable.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks factual information, analysis, or balanced reporting. It's primarily an expression of opinion, lacking the objectivity expected in journalistic content.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post appears to be a personal opinion, albeit expressed publicly and through a paid advertisement.  The negative sentiment towards \"Marcel\" is not presented as a call to action related to the parliamentary elections.  The lack of explicit connection to the elections weakens the argument for it being electoral propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1372085943774850</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post expresses a negative opinion about an individual named \"Marcel,\" but it lacks a clear connection to the parliamentary elections. While the post is a paid advertisement with a wide reach, the absence of explicit endorsement or opposition to any specific candidate, coupled with the lack of adherence to journalistic standards, makes it difficult to classify it as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The post's primary purpose seems to be expressing dissatisfaction rather than influencing votes.  The fact that it is paid for by For\u021ba Dreptei does not automatically make it electoral propaganda if it does not meet the criteria of Article 36 (7).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
