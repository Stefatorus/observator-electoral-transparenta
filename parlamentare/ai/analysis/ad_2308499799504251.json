It refers directly to a candidate (Brian Cristian), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs further investigation to determine if it's after the official end of the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Brian Cristian), and goes beyond the limits of journalistic reporting by being promotional and self-serving. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral propaganda.  The paid nature of the Facebook post and its targeting of a specific region (Maramure\u0219 County) indicate a deliberate attempt to influence voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 2308499799504251) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Brian Cristian la alegerile parlamentare,  folosind un ton promotional \u0219i auto-laudativ, eviden\u021biind realiz\u0103rile sale \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 se informeze corect \u00eenainte de a vota.
