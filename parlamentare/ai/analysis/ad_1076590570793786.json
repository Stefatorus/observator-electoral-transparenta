There is no CMF number present in the provided post.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions the PSD-PNL-USR coalition and implicitly refers to the upcoming parliamentary elections by criticizing the timing of the election date.  However, it does not explicitly name or endorse any specific parliamentary candidate. While it mentions \"rom\u00e2nii trebuie s\u0103 se prezinte la vot pentru o Rom\u00e2nie suveran\u0103,\" this is a general call to vote, not an endorsement of a specific candidate.

The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended for a wide audience, not a private communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post seems to be to criticize the PSD-PNL-USR coalition and their decision regarding the election date. While it encourages voting for a \"suveran\u0103\" Romania, it does not explicitly advocate for or against any particular candidate or party participating in the parliamentary elections. The call to vote is general and doesn't directly promote a specific candidate or party.  The linked article might contain more direct endorsements, but the Facebook post itself is more of a general political commentary.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post presents itself as a political opinion piece, similar to an opinion column in a newspaper. It expresses a viewpoint on a political matter (election timing) and encourages participation in the democratic process. While it has a clear political bias, it doesn't directly instruct voters on who to vote for or against. The style is more akin to opinion journalism than direct electoral propaganda.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>While the post expresses a strong opinion against the PSD-PNL-USR coalition, it does so in a way that is more of a political commentary than a direct attempt to influence votes for or against specific candidates. The language is strong, but the call to action is general (\"vote for a sovereign Romania\"), not specific (\"vote for AUR\").</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1076590570793786</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post primarily criticizes the PSD-PNL-USR coalition and their decision regarding the election date. While it encourages voting, it does not explicitly endorse any specific parliamentary candidate. The call to vote is general and doesn't directly promote a specific candidate or party.  The linked article might contain more direct endorsements, but the Facebook post itself is more of a general political commentary.  The lack of specific candidate endorsements, combined with the general call to vote, makes it less likely to be considered direct electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  However, the close proximity to the election and the clear political bias could be interpreted differently by a court.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
