While Poli\u021beanu holds a political office, the post's content is unrelated to the parliamentary elections.  The post does not mention any parliamentary candidates, parties, or promote any political agenda related to the elections. The objective is to inform the public about a community event, not to influence votes.  The paid nature of the post does not automatically make it electoral propaganda; the content itself must be analyzed. In this case, the content is clearly focused on a non-political community event.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
