It lacks any reference to parliamentary candidates or parties, its objective is purely informative, and it is presented in a journalistic style. The paid advertisement format on Facebook does not automatically qualify it as electoral propaganda; the content itself must meet the criteria defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  This post does not meet those criteria.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Videomedicina.ro</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
