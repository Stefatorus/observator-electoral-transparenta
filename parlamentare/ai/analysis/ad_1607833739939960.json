The post encourages voting and supporting preferred candidates, which could be interpreted as having an electoral objective.

The post primarily expresses a personal opinion about the importance of unity and overcoming political divisions.

While the call to vote could be interpreted as having a subtle electoral objective, the post's primary focus is on promoting national unity and overcoming political divisions.  The lack of specific endorsements, combined with the general appeal for unity, suggests that the post does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The post's content is more akin to a personal opinion piece or citizen journalism than a direct attempt to influence the vote for a particular candidate.  The image of the Romanian flag further reinforces the message of national unity.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
