While the post mentions C\u01celin Georgescu, it does so within a broader astrological and philosophical commentary on the Romanian presidential elections.  The mention is not a direct endorsement or attack, but rather an observation within a larger context.  It does not meet the criteria of Article 36 (7) - a, as the reference is not the primary focus or objective of the post.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a public Facebook post, paid for and designed to reach a wide audience. The use of hashtags further indicates an intention to reach a broad public.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post is not to influence the vote for or against any particular candidate. The post uses the election results as a springboard for a discussion on astrology, spirituality, and societal change. While the election is mentioned, it's not the central focus, and there's no explicit call to action to vote for or against anyone.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents an opinion piece, blending astrological interpretation with political commentary. While it's not strictly journalistic in the traditional sense, it attempts to offer an analysis of the election results through a unique lens. However, the lack of verifiable facts and reliance on astrological interpretations weakens its claim to journalistic objectivity.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>True. The post primarily expresses the author's personal interpretation of the election results through an astrological framework.  While it touches upon political events, the core message is a personal opinion and philosophical reflection, not a direct attempt to sway voters.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1312759263078017</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while mentioning the Romanian presidential elections and specifically C\u01celin Georgescu, does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. The post's primary focus is on astrological interpretation and philosophical commentary, not on directly influencing voters. The mention of C\u01celin Georgescu is incidental to the broader theme.  While the post addresses a wide audience, its objective is not to promote or hinder any candidate's electoral prospects.  The analysis presented blends personal opinion and astrological interpretation, lacking the objectivity expected of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>C\u0102LIN GEORGESCU</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
