The post explicitly mentions \"alegerile parlamentare din 1 decembrie\" (parliamentary elections on December 1st) and encourages voters to choose candidates who will be their voice in Parliament. While it doesn't name a specific candidate, it strongly implies support for the USR party given the \"USR Maramures\" byline and the CMF number associated with Brian Cristian, a USR candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>TRUE.

The primary objective is to persuade voters to support candidates who will represent their interests in Parliament.

The post uses statistics to highlight his achievements, directly linking them to the upcoming election. The call to action (\"vote for candidates who will be your voice\") and the overall tone clearly aim to influence voters' choices. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral propaganda.  While the post doesn't explicitly mention voting for Brian Cristian by name, the context and the byline leave no doubt about its intended effect. The spending of RON 400-499 and the reach of 6K-7K impressions indicate a significant effort to influence voters.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a potential violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 1043264764266897) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 indirect candidatura lui Brian Cristian la alegerile parlamentare din 1 decembrie, folosind statistici pentru a-i eviden\u021bia realiz\u0103rile \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 voteze candida\u021bi care le vor reprezenta interesele \u00een Parlament.
