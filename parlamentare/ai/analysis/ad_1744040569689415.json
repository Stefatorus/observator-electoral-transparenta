The content is purely informational, announcing the dates and times of religious services. There is no mention of any political candidate, party, or any attempt to influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections. The paid advertisement targets a geographical area, but this is for disseminating information about a local religious event, not for political campaigning.  The post does not violate Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 because it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda.  It does not directly refer to a candidate or party, its objective is not electoral, and it remains within the bounds of community news reporting.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
