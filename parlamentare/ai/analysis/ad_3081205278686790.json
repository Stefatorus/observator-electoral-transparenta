While indirectly related to the political process, it does not explicitly endorse any parliamentary candidate or party. The post's primary focus is on a social issue, using voting as a means to achieve a broader goal.  The lack of specific candidate mention, combined with the focus on a broader social issue, suggests that it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The paid nature of the post and its wide reach are factors to consider, but they do not automatically classify it as electoral propaganda if the content itself does not directly advocate for a specific candidate or party.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Centrul FILIA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
