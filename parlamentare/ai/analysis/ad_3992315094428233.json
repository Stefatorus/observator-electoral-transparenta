This strongly suggests electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are mandatory for electoral campaign materials in Romania.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>While the post doesn't explicitly name a candidate, the image clearly shows a person and the text mentions \"Pozi\u021bia 12 pe buletinul de vot\" (Position 12 on the ballot).  The logo of the PNCR (Partidul Na\u021bional Conservator Rom\u00e2n) is prominently displayed. This strongly implies a reference to a specific candidate from this party running for the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently targeting a wide audience. The message is not a private communication but aims to reach many people within Arad County and beyond, as evidenced by the reach estimate (100K - 500K).</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to vote for the candidate in position 12 on the ballot, who is affiliated with the PNCR.  Phrases like \"Ie\u0219i la vot!\", \"Alege schimbarea,\" and the emphasis on the importance of the parliamentary elections clearly aim to influence voting behavior.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and presents a biased perspective, advocating for a specific candidate and party. While it touches upon political issues, its purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade voters.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content transcends personal opinion. It's a carefully crafted message designed to promote a specific candidate and party, going beyond the expression of personal views.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3992315094428233</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It refers to a specific candidate (position 12 on the ballot from PNCR), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs further investigation to confirm if it's after the official end of the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for PNCR), and goes beyond journalistic reporting by actively promoting a candidate. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The paid nature of the Facebook post confirms its intention to reach a wide audience.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PNCR Candidate at Position 12</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nLIBRA OFFICE IND.
