The project's goals and activities are clearly stated, and there is no attempt to influence voters' choices in the election. The timing of the post, even if after the official campaign period, is irrelevant because the content is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Romania Eficienta</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
