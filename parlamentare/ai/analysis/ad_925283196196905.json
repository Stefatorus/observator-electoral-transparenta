While politically charged, it does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. The post's primary objective is to promote viewership of the news segment, not to influence the parliamentary elections.  The content is presented in a journalistic style, informing the public about a relevant political event.  The absence of any explicit endorsement or opposition to parliamentary candidates, combined with the journalistic presentation, suggests that the post does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Fanatik Online</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
