This strongly suggests the post is related to electoral propaganda.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post explicitly names Iosifescu Victor-Ion as a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies in D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County.  The image clearly shows the candidate and the text \"Voteaz\u0103 reper\" (Vote for REPER) further reinforces the connection to a specific candidate and party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The targeting parameters (age, gender, location) further confirm its intention to reach a broad segment of the population in D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to support Iosifescu Victor-Ion and the REPER party in the parliamentary elections. The phrase \"Voteaz\u0103 reper\" (Vote for REPER) and the highlighting of the candidate's name and affiliation leave no doubt about the post's electoral intent. The message \"Tourism brings economic development!\" is clearly intended to appeal to voters and promote the candidate's platform.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present information in a journalistic manner. It lacks objectivity and instead promotes a specific candidate and party.  It is not an analysis or opinion piece but a direct appeal for votes.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content is not a personal opinion; it's a clearly structured political advertisement designed to influence voting behavior. The statement about tourism is presented as a campaign promise, not a personal reflection.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1304837790688838</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, identified by ad_archive_id 1304837790688838, fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It directly refers to a specific candidate (Iosifescu Victor-Ion), is clearly intended to influence the vote in favor of the REPER party, targets a wide audience in D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County, and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing, after the official end of the campaign period, is a significant factor.  While the ad's end date is after the election, the fact that it was active during the period when such ads are prohibited is a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>IOSIFESCU VICTOR-ION</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame electorale pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1304837790688838) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul IOSIFESCU VICTOR-ION pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor \u00een jude\u021bul D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, utiliz\u00e2nd imaginea acestuia \u0219i \u00eendemnul explicit \u201eVoteaz\u0103 reper\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea candidatului \u0219i partidului REPER.
