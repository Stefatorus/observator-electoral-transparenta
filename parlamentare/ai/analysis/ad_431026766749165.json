The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose specific candidates, its clear objective is to influence the election by increasing voter participation within a particular demographic.  The post's language is persuasive and emphasizes the potential negative consequences of not voting, thus fulfilling the criteria of electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post's targeting and messaging are designed to sway voters, even without explicitly mentioning candidates. The fact that the post was paid for and targeted a specific demographic further strengthens the argument that it constitutes electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Bihar Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 431026766749165), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 prin \u00eendemnul explicit la vot adresat comunit\u0103\u021bii maghiare din jude\u021bul Bihor, f\u0103r\u0103 a men\u021biona candida\u021bi specifici, dar cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba rezultatul alegerilor parlamentare.
