The hashtags used are geographical and related to the publication's name.  There is no mention of any political party, candidate, or any call to action related to voting. The post's primary purpose seems to be to showcase the beauty of the city, not to influence the parliamentary elections. While the post falls under the \"POLITICAL\" category due to the publisher's nature, the content itself lacks any elements that constitute electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 and Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
