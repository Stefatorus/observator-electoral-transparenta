While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate by name, it clearly refers to Mara Tog\u0103nel, who is running for office.  The post uses \"I\" and \"me\" and refers to her campaign and the trust placed in her by voters. This implicitly identifies her as a candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just a select few. The phrasing \"ie\u0219i m\u00e2ine la vot!\" (go out to vote tomorrow) is a clear call to action to a broad audience.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage people to vote. While it doesn't explicitly endorse Mara Tog\u0103nel, the context strongly suggests that the desired outcome is increased voter turnout, which would indirectly benefit her campaign. The personal appeal and the emphasis on her connection to the community aim to build trust and support.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It's a personal appeal from a candidate, focusing on building trust and encouraging participation in the election, rather than providing unbiased information.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses personal beliefs (\"Cred \u00een Dumnezeu. Cred \u00een mure\u0219eni\"), these are used to build a connection with the audience and encourage voting, serving an electoral purpose. It's not a purely personal opinion unrelated to the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>606719112020297</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while not explicitly urging voters to choose Mara Tog\u0103nel, functions as electoral propaganda. It leverages her public profile to encourage voting, implicitly benefiting her campaign. The post's paid nature, broad reach, and personal appeal, combined with the timing (a day before the election), strongly suggest an intention to influence the election outcome.  The lack of explicit endorsement is a mitigating factor, but the overall effect is still promotional.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Mara Tog\u0103nel</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMara Tog\u0103nel, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 606719112020297) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 explicit la votarea sa, constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 prin apelul personal la aleg\u0103tori,  accentu\u00e2nd \u00eencrederea acordat\u0103 de peste 47.000 de mure\u0219eni \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la participarea la vot cu fraza \"ie\u0219i m\u00e2ine la vot!\", av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv asupra campaniei sale.
