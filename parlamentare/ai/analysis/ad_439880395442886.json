It refers to a specific candidate (Maria Gabriela Horga), is clearly used for electoral purposes, targets a wide audience, and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion. The post's objective is to positively influence voters' opinions of Horga and encourage them to vote for her.  The images of other PNL candidates further strengthen the propaganda aspect.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Maria Gabriela Horga</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Toma Petcu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Florin Nidelea</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nForges Policy, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 439880395442886) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul PNL la Senat, Maria Gabriela Horga, precum \u0219i al\u021bi candida\u021bi PNL,  prin eviden\u021bierea realiz\u0103rilor lor \u0219i a apartenen\u021bei la PNL, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea pozitiv\u0103 a votului \u00een favoarea acestora.
