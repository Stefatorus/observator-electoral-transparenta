It refers to a specific candidate (Andrei Plujar), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to choose him in the parliamentary elections. The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a violation of Article 98 t).  While the ad library shows the ad ran before the end of the official campaign period, the fact that it is still active after the end of the campaign period is a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Andrei Plujar</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Cara\u0219-Severin, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1665040587725701) cu scopul de a promova candidatura lui Andrei Plujar la alegerile parlamentare, con\u021bin\u00e2nd elemente de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, inclusiv num\u0103rul CMF 11240015,  adres\u00e2ndu-se publicului larg printr-o postare pl\u0103tit\u0103 pe Facebook, cu o cheltuial\u0103 estimat\u0103 \u00eentre 1000 \u0219i 1500 RON \u0219i o estimare a num\u0103rului de impresii \u00eentre 30.000 \u0219i 35.000, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea candidatului men\u021bionat.
