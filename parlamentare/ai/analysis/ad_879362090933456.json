It uses statistics about life expectancy to highlight shortcomings in the healthcare system, implicitly linking them to the need for change and suggesting Manolache Vasile as a solution. The post's call to vote on December 1st, combined with the candidate's name prominently displayed, clearly aims to influence voters' choices.  While not explicitly endorsing Manolache Vasile, the implicit message is strong enough to constitute electoral propaganda. The post's reach (100K-500K) and spend (under RON 100) further support this conclusion.  The post's content and targeting align with the definition of electoral propaganda under Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The fact that the post was published after the official campaign period ended (end_date: 1732867200, which corresponds to November 26th, 2024) further strengthens the case for a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 879362090933456) cu scop electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Manolache Vasile la Senat.
