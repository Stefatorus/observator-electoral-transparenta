While it doesn't mention specific candidates, its clear objective is to influence the election outcome in favor of the RMDSZ. The targeting data shows a focus on Timi\u0219 County, indicating a localized electoral strategy. The post's content lacks journalistic objectivity, instead presenting a partisan viewpoint.  The paid nature of the advertisement on a public platform further reinforces its classification as electoral propaganda.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is a crucial factor.  Although the exact date of posting is not explicitly stated, the provided data suggests it may fall outside the legal timeframe for electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUDMR Org Jud Timis, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1524370898242614) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 implicit partidul RMDSZ \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot \u00een favoarea acestuia, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar.
