It directly refers to a candidate (Manolache Vasile), uses campaign-style messaging, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate). The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral material.  The post's content, while mentioning local businesses, is clearly designed to influence voters in favor of Manolache Vasile. The argument that it's about supporting local businesses is weak, as the context and presentation strongly suggest an electoral purpose.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>MANOLACHE VASILE</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>SOS</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri electorale pe Facebook (ID: 569215805798224), care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Manolache Vasile (Partidul S.O.S.
