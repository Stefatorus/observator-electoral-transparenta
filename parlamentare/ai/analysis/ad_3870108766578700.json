While presented as a news article, the content focuses on negative aspects of a specific candidate (Adrian Cozma) from the PNL.  The inclusion of a link to a full article suggests an intention to influence public opinion, potentially negatively impacting Cozma's electoral prospects. This raises concerns about fulfilling Article 36 (7) - c, as the objective could be interpreted as influencing the vote.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post is formatted like a news headline and includes a link to a news article. However, the highly critical and potentially defamatory nature of the headline raises questions about its journalistic objectivity. The focus seems to be on damaging the reputation of a specific candidate rather than providing balanced, unbiased information.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it presents information in a way that suggests a negative portrayal of a political figure. The lack of personal pronouns and the use of a news-style headline indicate an attempt to present the information as factual rather than opinion-based.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3870108766578700</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while formatted as a news article, exhibits characteristics of electoral propaganda. It directly mentions a specific candidate (Adrian Cozma, PNL), uses a potentially defamatory headline to negatively portray him, and aims for wide reach through a paid Facebook advertisement.  While the post links to a longer article, the headline itself is concise and designed to create a negative impression. The paid nature of the post, targeting a significant audience in Satu Mare County, further strengthens the argument that it is intended to influence voters.  The lack of clear journalistic objectivity and the potential for defamation raise serious concerns.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be considered, but the evidence strongly suggests an attempt to influence the election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Adrian Cozma</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Gazeta de Nord-Vest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nGazeta de Nord-Vest, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 3870108766578700, care con\u021bine afirma\u021bii def\u0103im\u0103toare la adresa candidatului Adrian Cozma, pre\u0219edintele PNL Satu Mare, prezentate \u00eentr-un mod care sugereaz\u0103 o inten\u021bie clar\u0103 de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
