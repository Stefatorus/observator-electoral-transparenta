The \"payer_beneficiary_data\" in the `aaa_info` section explicitly states that the payer is \"Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor\" and the beneficiary is \"R\u0103zvan Biro\".

The \"payer_beneficiary_data\" in the `aaa_info` section confirms the link between the advertisement and the AUR party. The post's content and context strongly indicate an intention to influence the vote.  While the post doesn't explicitly mention voting for a specific candidate by name, the context and the CMF number leave little doubt about its purpose.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>R\u0103zvan Biro</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[R\u0103zvan Biro], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 499403779084639, care con\u021bine un mesaj electoral persuasiv, utiliz\u00e2nd limbaj patriotic puternic (\"unim toat\u0103 suflarea rom\u00e2neasc\u0103,\" \"rescriem istoria,\" \"redob\u00e2ndirii demnit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i suveranit\u0103\u021bii na\u021bionale\") \u0219i un apel direct la ac\u021biune \u00een ziua alegerilor (\"duminic\u0103, prin votul nostru\").
