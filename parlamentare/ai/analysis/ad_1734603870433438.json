It refers directly to a candidate (Dan Cosma), is used during the electoral campaign (although the end date is given as 1732953600, which needs to be checked against the actual electoral calendar), has a clear electoral objective (promoting Cosma's candidacy), and is targeted at a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content goes beyond simple information; it actively promotes a candidate and encourages voting for him.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Dan Cosma</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nDan Cosma, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1734603870433438) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura sa pentru Senat \u0219i Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea AUR, cu men\u021bionarea explicit\u0103 a pozi\u021biei sale pe buletinul de vot (\"pozi\u021bia 1 pe buletinul de vot\") \u0219i link-uri c\u0103tre platforma sa electoral\u0103 (planulsimion.ro \u0219i programaur.ro), av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a voturilor \u00een favoarea sa \u0219i a partidului AUR.
