It does not promote any political candidate or party, nor does it attempt to influence voters in any way. The content is entirely focused on raising funds for educational purposes.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement on Facebook does not automatically make it electoral propaganda. The target audience is broad, aiming to attract donations from anyone interested in supporting education. There is no mention of any political party, candidate, or election-related issues.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Asociatia Umanista Romana</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
