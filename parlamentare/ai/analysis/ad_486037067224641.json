This is not conclusive evidence of non-propaganda, as CMF numbers are not always present in all political advertising, especially on platforms like Facebook. However, its absence is a factor to consider.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post explicitly mentions \"szavazz\" (vote in Hungarian), implicitly urging people to vote. While it doesn't name a specific candidate, the context strongly suggests it's related to the RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania), a political party participating in the parliamentary elections.  This aligns with Article 36 (7) - a, as it refers to a political party participating in elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The ad was a paid Facebook post, targeting a wide audience in Covasna, Harghita, and Mure\u0219 counties, areas with significant Hungarian-speaking populations.  The reach estimate (100K-500K) further supports the conclusion that it was intended for a broad audience. This satisfies Article 36 (7) - c.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be encouraging voters to participate in the election.  The inclusion of Bagossy Norbi, a popular Hungarian singer, suggests an attempt to leverage his influence to boost voter turnout for the RMDSZ. This strongly suggests an electoral objective, fulfilling Article 36 (7) - c. The use of the hashtag #szavazz (vote) further reinforces this intention.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic in nature. It lacks the characteristics of objective reporting, analysis, or opinion pieces. Instead, it directly promotes participation in the election, which is a clear deviation from journalistic standards.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post is not expressing a personal opinion; it's a clear call to action, urging voters to participate in the election.  The involvement of a celebrity further emphasizes the promotional nature of the content.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>486037067224641</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by RMDSZ, strongly suggests electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't explicitly mention a candidate's name, the context (RMDSZ affiliation, call to vote, use of a celebrity endorsement) clearly aims to influence voter behavior in favor of the RMDSZ during the parliamentary elections. The targeting of specific regions with significant Hungarian-speaking populations further strengthens this interpretation.  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to negate the evidence of propaganda.  The post fulfills the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 486037067224641), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot f\u0103r\u0103 a specifica un candidat, dar \u00een contextul campaniei electorale pentru alegerile parlamentare, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv pentru RMDSZ.
