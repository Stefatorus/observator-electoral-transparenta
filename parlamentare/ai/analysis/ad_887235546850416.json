It refers directly to a candidate (Claudiu-Iorga Palaz), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual end date of the electoral campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to promote the candidate and influence voters), and is targeted at a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The only potential argument against it being propaganda would be if the electoral campaign period had officially ended before the post was published.  However, given the information provided, this seems unlikely.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Claudiu-Iorga Palaz</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nClaudiu-Iorga Palaz, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (verifica\u021bi data exact\u0103 a \u00eencheierii campaniei electorale), cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 887235546850416,  av\u00e2nd ca scop promovarea candidaturii sale la alegerile parlamentare pentru For\u021ba Dreptei.
