It fulfills all the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006: it refers directly to a specific candidate (Georgeta Dogaru), it was published during the electoral campaign period (as evidenced by the start and end dates), it has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes for REPER), and it surpasses the boundaries of journalistic reporting by being a direct endorsement. The post's paid nature and targeting parameters further solidify its intention to influence voters.  While the post doesn't explicitly violate Article 98 t) by advising voters *at* polling stations, it does violate the spirit of the law by continuing electoral propaganda after the official campaign period (assuming the post was published after the official end date). The fact that it's a paid advertisement targeting a specific demographic in a specific region makes it a clear attempt to influence the election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Georgeta Dogaru</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1260800031733382), cu mesajul \"Georgeta Dogaru - candidat\u01ce la Senat pentru D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba din partea partidului REPER.
