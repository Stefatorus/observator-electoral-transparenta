While the absence of a CMF number is not automatically disqualifying, it suggests the post might not be directly linked to official electoral campaign materials.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post refers to \"oameni care s\u0103 reprezinte interesul poporului rom\u00e2n\", which is a general statement and doesn't specifically identify a parliamentary candidate by name or party affiliation.  While the \"byline\" mentions AUR, the body of the message is not directly tied to a specific candidate. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not strictly apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message (\"Vota\u021bi pentru o Rom\u00e2niei puternic\u0103!\") is clearly intended to reach a wide audience.  Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's call to action (\"Vota\u021bi pentru o Rom\u00e2niei puternic\u0103!\") aims to encourage voting for a strong Romania. While not explicitly endorsing a specific candidate, it implicitly promotes the general platform of the AUR party, which is mentioned in the byline. This could be interpreted as having an electoral objective, aiming to increase support for the party.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c could potentially apply.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post lacks the characteristics of journalistic reporting. It does not present factual information, analysis, or diverse perspectives. Instead, it presents a partisan appeal for voting. It does not meet the standards of journalistic objectivity.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; rather, it promotes a political party's general message. The statement about representing the people's interest, while vague, is a common political slogan.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>888476750124491</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post is borderline. While it doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate, the call to vote for a \"strong Romania\" coupled with the AUR party byline strongly suggests an intention to influence voters in favor of AUR. The lack of a CMF number weakens the case for a direct violation, but the paid nature of the Facebook post, its broad reach, and its clear political message make it a potential violation.  The ambiguity lies in whether the general appeal constitutes direct electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards a non-violation, but it's a close call.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Leonard Fleican</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
