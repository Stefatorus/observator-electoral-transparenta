It directly refers to a candidate (Alina Gorghiu) and her party (PNL), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by the \"Duminic\u0103\" reference to election day), has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes), and surpasses the boundaries of journalistic reporting by explicitly advocating for a specific candidate and party. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's paid nature and broad reach on Facebook solidify its intention to influence voters.
