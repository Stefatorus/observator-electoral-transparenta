The post's targeting, call to action, and association with the PSD clearly indicate an intention to influence the election outcome.  While it doesn't explicitly mention specific candidates, the implicit endorsement of the PSD constitutes electoral propaganda. The post was published after the official campaign period ended, potentially violating Article 98 t).  The ad's reach (100K-500K) and spend (RON 200-299) further highlight its potential impact.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nGabriel Valer Zetea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 1295415661810762, care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul Social Democrat (PSD) \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 direct la votarea acestuia \u00een alegerile locale.
