While the post falls under the \"POLITICAL\" category, there's no explicit call to action to vote for or against any specific candidate.

Given the lack of explicit endorsements or calls to action, the content might represent the expression of opinions or analysis, rather than propaganda aimed at influencing votes.

The lack of specific candidate mentions, the absence of a CMF number, and the apparent focus on general political commentary or public opinion polling, rather than direct calls to vote for or against specific candidates, suggest that it does not violate Article 98 t).  However, a definitive conclusion requires reviewing the actual content of the post and images. The targeting parameters are broad, but this alone does not constitute electoral propaganda. The \"POLITICAL\" category is not sufficient to automatically classify it as such.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Opinia Cet\u0103\u021beanului</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
