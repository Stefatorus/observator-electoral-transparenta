The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name, surname, or any other clear identifier.  The link leads to a website (\"eucucinevotez.eu\") which, without further information, cannot be definitively linked to a specific candidate or party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and therefore addresses a wide population. The reach estimate is 100K-500K.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Uncertain. The post's text (\"We look at what politicians do, not just what they say.\") and the link to \"eucucinevotez.eu\" suggest a focus on evaluating politicians' actions. However, without knowing the content of the linked website, it's impossible to definitively determine whether the objective is to influence votes for or against specific candidates. The post could be interpreted as encouraging critical engagement with political figures, which is not inherently electoral propaganda.  However, the website's content is crucial for a conclusive assessment.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially. The statement \"We look at what politicians do, not just what they say\" could be seen as a journalistic approach, focusing on fact-checking and holding politicians accountable.  However, this depends entirely on the content of the linked website. If the website provides unbiased information and analysis, it could be considered journalistic. If it promotes a particular candidate or party, it would be considered propaganda.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Unlikely. The post doesn't express a personal opinion; rather, it presents a statement that could be interpreted as a call for critical analysis of politicians.  This is not necessarily a personal opinion but a general statement.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1250918116160000</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe analysis is inconclusive. While the post is targeted towards a wide audience and is paid for, the content itself is ambiguous. The statement \"We look at what politicians do, not just what they say\" is not inherently electoral propaganda. However, the linked website (\"eucucinevotez.eu\") is crucial.  If the website contains unbiased information and analysis, the post would likely not be considered electoral propaganda. If the website promotes a specific candidate or party, or advocates for voting for or against a specific candidate, then the post would likely be considered electoral propaganda.  The lack of information about the website's content prevents a definitive conclusion.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>DifinePR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
