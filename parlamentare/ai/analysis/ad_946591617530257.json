It directly encourages voters to support him by highlighting the need for improved healthcare and linking this issue to his platform. The post's design, hashtags, and call to action clearly aim to influence the election outcome.  While it doesn't explicitly mention the election date, the reference to December 1st, coupled with the context of the Romanian parliamentary elections, makes the intent clear. The post fulfills all criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, defining it as electoral propaganda.  The fact that it was published after the official campaign period ended (assuming the end date in the metadata is accurate) constitutes a violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. The reach of the post (8K-9K impressions, 100K-500K reach estimate) further underscores its potential impact on the election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 946591617530257) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Manolache Vasile la Senat, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot \u00een favoarea sa prin sublinierea necesit\u0103\u0163ii \u00eembun\u0103t\u0103\u0163irii sistemului sanitar.
