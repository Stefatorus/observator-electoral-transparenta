It refers to a specific political party (RMDSZ) participating in the elections, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support the RMDSZ.  The post's call to action leaves no doubt about its intention to sway public opinion in favor of the party.  The fact that the post is a paid advertisement further strengthens the argument that it is intended for electoral purposes.  While the post does not contain a CMF number, this is not a decisive factor in determining whether it is electoral propaganda. The content itself is sufficient to classify it as such.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vincze Lor\u00e1nt</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVincze Lor\u00e1nt, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1084383169604194), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit partidul RMDSZ, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd publicul la vot \u00een favoarea acestuia cu fraza \"Vas\u00e1rnap vegy\u00fcnk r\u00e9szt a v\u00e1laszt\u00e1son \u00e9s t\u00e1mogassuk az RMDSZ-t!\", av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a votului \u00een favoarea RMDSZ.
