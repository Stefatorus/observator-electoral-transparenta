While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to an officially registered candidate's campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"Costel Barbu\".  Without further context, it's impossible to definitively determine if this refers to a parliamentary candidate.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain if \"Costel Barbu\" is a candidate in the parliamentary elections. If he is, and the post aims to promote his candidacy, then Article 36 (7) - a would apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The targeting parameters (Teleorman County, Romania; age 18-65) further confirm its intention to address a broad segment of the population. Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The content focuses on achievements and promises related to improvements in infrastructure (\"drumuri mai bune\"), healthcare (\"spitale moderne\"), and living conditions (\"condi\u021bii decente\"). While presented as accomplishments, these are common themes in electoral campaigns. The phrasing \"Nu sunt doar promisiuni de campanie. Sunt fapte\" directly addresses the electoral context.  The overall objective appears to be to positively influence voters' perception of Costel Barbu, potentially increasing votes.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c applies.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and presents information in a highly favorable light, promoting a specific individual rather than providing balanced reporting. The language used is promotional, not journalistic.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post is not a personal opinion. It's a structured presentation of achievements and promises, clearly intended to sway public opinion in favor of Costel Barbu. The use of paid advertising further reinforces this intention.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3810306719208323</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly mentioning a political party or directly urging voters to vote for a specific candidate, strongly suggests electoral propaganda. The focus on achievements and promises, the targeting of a specific geographical area, and the use of paid advertising all point towards an attempt to influence voters' choices. The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the overall impression of electoral propaganda, especially if Costel Barbu is a parliamentary candidate.  The Romanian text is heavily suggestive of electoral campaigning.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Costel Barbu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Total Impact</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTotal Impact, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 3810306719208323), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu un buget sub 100 RON, care promoveaz\u0103 imaginea lui Costel Barbu, folosind un limbaj sugestiv de campanie electoral\u0103 \u0219i eviden\u021biind realiz\u0103ri \u0219i promisiuni specifice unei campanii electorale, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea pozitiv\u0103 a opiniei publice asupra candidatului, cu scopul de a-i cre\u0219te num\u0103rul de voturi.
