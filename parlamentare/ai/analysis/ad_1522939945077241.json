It refers to a specific candidate (Sebastian Tiberiu Pop), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by the end date), has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion. The post's content and targeting clearly aim to influence voters' choices in the upcoming elections.  The only potential argument against it being electoral propaganda would be if the electoral campaign period had officially ended before the post's publication date. However, given the provided information, this does not seem to be the case.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Sebastian Tiberiu Pop</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Sebastian - Tiberiu Pop], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1522939945077241) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura sa la Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea PNCR,  con\u021bin\u00e2nd un mesaj explicit de sus\u021binere a candidaturii sale \u0219i \u00eendemn la vot,  precum \u0219i men\u021bionarea unui num\u0103r CMF (CMF11240003), fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale.
