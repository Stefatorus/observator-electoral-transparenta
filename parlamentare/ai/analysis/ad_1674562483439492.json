This strongly suggests it is electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are mandatory for political advertising in Romania.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post explicitly mentions the PNL (Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal) and quotes Adrian Ioan Ve\u0219tea, the secretary-general of the PNL.  This directly refers to a parliamentary candidate and their party.  Article 36 (7) - a applies.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>This is a paid Facebook post, targeting a wide audience (reach estimate >1M). It's not a private communication; it's designed for public consumption.  Therefore, it addresses the wide population. </addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's content aims to positively influence voters' perception of the PNL. Phrases like \"PNL a demonstrat c\u0103 \u0219tie \u0219i poate moderniza Rom\u00e2nia\" and \"Lupt\u0103m pentru Rom\u00e2nia, lupt\u0103m pentru PNL!\" clearly aim to encourage people to vote for the PNL. The objective is to influence the vote. Article 36 (7) - c applies.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It lacks objective reporting and instead promotes a specific political party.  It's not an opinion piece in the journalistic sense; it's a direct appeal for votes.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>While the post includes a personal anecdote (\"Succesul pe care l-am ob\u021binut...\"), it's clearly subordinated to the main objective of promoting the PNL. The personal element is used to bolster the party's image, not to express a personal opinion unrelated to the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1674562483439492</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It refers directly to a specific political party (PNL), is used during the electoral campaign (although the exact date is not specified, the ad archive suggests it was active during the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes for PNL), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The post's content is explicitly designed to influence voters in favor of the PNL.  The counter-argument could be that the personal anecdote at the beginning is not directly related to the election, but this is a minor element overshadowed by the clear political message.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Adrian Ioan Ve\u0219tea</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n\u0218erban Todoric\u0103-Constantin, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1674562483439492) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru PNL,  cu un buget de 100-199 RON,  ajung\u00e2nd la peste 1 milion de oameni,  prin citarea lui Adrian Ioan Ve\u0219tea \u0219i afirma\u021bii precum \u201ePNL a demonstrat c\u0103 \u0219tie \u0219i poate moderniza Rom\u00e2nia\u201d \u0219i \u201eLupt\u0103m pentru Rom\u00e2nia, lupt\u0103m pentru PNL!\u201d,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea PNL.
