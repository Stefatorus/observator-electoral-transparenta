While not directly related to parliamentary elections, his position is a political one, and the post uses his image and name.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language (\"Dragi s\u0103celeni\" - Dear people of Sacele) and the call to action (participate in the survey) further confirm this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post seems to be to gather input for the local budget.  While Virgil Popa's image and name are used, the content focuses on community engagement and local development, not on influencing votes for any specific election. The link directs to a survey about the local budget, not to a voting page or any other electoral-related action.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post could be considered a form of communication from a public figure, it doesn't adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and is clearly promotional in nature, aiming to engage the community in a process directly related to the mayor's responsibilities.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post is not expressing a personal opinion; it's a structured communication from a public official promoting a specific action (participating in a survey).</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1653933732198160</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post uses the image and name of Virgil Popa, the Mayor of Sacele.  While this could be considered a form of self-promotion, the content itself focuses on community engagement regarding the local budget.  The call to action is to participate in a survey, not to vote for a specific candidate.  The post does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections.  The use of the mayor's image might be considered borderline, but given the focus on local budget planning, it doesn't clearly violate Article 98 t).  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle applies here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
