While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being considered electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be officially sanctioned campaign material.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"F\u0103r\u0103 Lasconi la Cotroceni!\".  Elena-Valeria Lasconi is a candidate for the presidential elections, not the parliamentary elections. While the post indirectly refers to a political figure, it does not directly refer to a candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not strictly apply to the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The reach estimate is \">1M\", confirming its broad targeting.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The statement \"Avortul este \u00eenchinare la idoli. F\u0103r\u0103 Lasconi la Cotroceni!\" expresses a strong opinion on abortion and implicitly opposes Lasconi's candidacy. While not directly advocating for a specific parliamentary candidate, it attempts to influence voters' opinions on a political issue related to a presidential candidate. This could indirectly influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections, depending on voters' alignment with the expressed views.  The objective is debatable, but there's a potential for indirect electoral influence.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post lacks the characteristics of journalistic reporting. It presents a strong opinionated statement rather than objective information or analysis. It does not adhere to journalistic standards of neutrality and balanced reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>While the post expresses a personal opinion, it's presented in a manner clearly intended to sway public opinion, going beyond a simple expression of personal belief. The strong, declarative language and the clear opposition to a political figure suggest an intention to influence voters.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>956323616316908</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not directly promoting or opposing a parliamentary candidate, expresses a strong opinion on a politically charged issue and implicitly opposes a presidential candidate. This could indirectly influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections. The paid nature of the Facebook post, targeting a wide audience, further strengthens the argument that it is intended to influence public opinion. However, the lack of direct reference to parliamentary candidates and the fact that the post targets a presidential candidate makes a definitive conclusion difficult.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards a non-violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Elena-Valeria Lasconi</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
