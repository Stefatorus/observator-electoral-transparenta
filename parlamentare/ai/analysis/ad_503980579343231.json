The phrase \"Holnap nem vesz\u00edthet\u00fcnk\" (Tomorrow we cannot lose) strongly suggests an electoral objective.  While not explicitly mentioning a candidate, the timing (the day before the election) and the implied urgency create a strong call to action, implicitly urging voters to support the RMDSZ.

The targeting data shows it's aimed at a wide audience in Maros County.  While it doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) - a (direct reference to a candidate), it arguably violates Article 36 (7) - c (electoral objective) and potentially falls under the prohibition of Article 98 t) due to its implicit call to action and its timing. The lack of explicit candidate mention might be considered \"in dubio pro reo,\" but the overall context strongly suggests an attempt to influence the vote.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Maros Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame politice pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu mesajul \"Holnap nem vesz\u00edthet\u00fcnk\", difuzat\u0103 dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul \u00een favoarea RMDSZ \u00een alegerile parlamentare.
