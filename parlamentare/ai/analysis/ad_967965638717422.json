It refers directly to a specific parliamentary candidate (AUR), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to choose AUR. The content is not journalistic or a personal opinion; it's a direct endorsement.  The post's timing is crucial; even if the exact date isn't specified, the context strongly suggests it's related to the parliamentary elections. The ad library data shows a significant spend (RON300-RON399) and a substantial reach (100K-500K).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor (AUR)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Ciprian Paraschiv</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nCiprian Paraschiv, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 967965638717422), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit partidul AUR, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la votul pentru acesta cu fraza \"Vot\u0103m AUR\", av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a votan\u021bilor \u00een favoarea AUR.
