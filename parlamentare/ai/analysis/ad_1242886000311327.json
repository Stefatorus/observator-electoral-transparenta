The post explicitly mentions Elena-Valeria Lasconi, a candidate in the 2024 Presidential elections.  It focuses heavily on her stance on abortion and its potential inclusion in the Romanian Constitution. This directly relates to her political platform and aims to influence voters' opinions on her candidacy.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language used (\"Dragi cre\u0219tini \u0219i oameni de bun\u0103-credin\u021b\u0103 ai Rom\u00e2niei\") further suggests an attempt to appeal to a broad segment of the population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to persuade voters *not* to vote for Elena-Valeria Lasconi.  The post uses strong, emotionally charged language (\"Moartea \u00een Constitu\u021bia Rom\u00e2niei,\" \"pruncucidere,\" \"mai r\u0103u dec\u00e2t sclavia\") to create a negative association with Lasconi's views on abortion and to dissuade voters from supporting her. The concluding sentence, \"F\u0103r\u0103 Lasconi la Cotroceni!\", directly calls for her electoral defeat.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post cites a HotNews article, it does not present a balanced or objective analysis of Lasconi's position. Instead, it selectively uses information to build a case against her, employing emotionally charged rhetoric and unsubstantiated claims (\"A dovedit o \u0219iretenie cras\u0103\"). This goes beyond the scope of journalistic reporting and enters the realm of political advocacy.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While presented as an opinion, the post transcends a simple expression of personal views. It actively campaigns against a specific candidate using persuasive techniques and inflammatory language, clearly aiming to influence the electoral outcome. The post is not a neutral observation but a targeted attack on Lasconi's political platform.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1242886000311327</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by Peter Costea, clearly constitutes electoral propaganda. It directly targets Elena-Valeria Lasconi, a presidential candidate, using emotionally charged language and biased arguments to dissuade voters from supporting her. The post's objective is explicitly electoral, aiming to influence the outcome of the election. The post's content goes beyond journalistic reporting, instead engaging in partisan political advocacy.  The use of a paid Facebook advertisement amplifies its reach and impact, making it a clear violation of regulations prohibiting electoral propaganda after the official campaign period. The post's reach (9K-10K impressions) and spend (RON 100-199) further demonstrate the intent to influence voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Elena-Valeria Lasconi</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPeter Costea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1242886000311327), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 negativ\u0103 \u00eendreptat\u0103 \u00eempotriva candidatei Elena-Valeria Lasconi.
