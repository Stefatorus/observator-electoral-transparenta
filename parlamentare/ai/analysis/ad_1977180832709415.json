While it doesn't explicitly mention specific candidates, the call to action and the framing of the political landscape as a \"war between parties and people\" clearly aims to influence voters towards independent candidates. The post's reach (100K-500K) and spend (RON 900-999) indicate a significant effort to sway public opinion.  The timing of the post, close to election day, further strengthens the argument that it constitutes electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number doesn't negate this, as the law doesn't explicitly mandate it for all forms of political advertising.  The argument against it being journalism is that it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic pieces. It's a persuasive message, not an informative one.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Independent Candidates</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVirgil Pirvulescu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1977180832709415), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 votul pentru candida\u021bii independen\u021bi, folosind mesaje persuasive precum \u201eR\u0103zboiul este \u00eentre PARTIDE \u0219i OAMENI\u201d \u0219i \u00eendemnul la ac\u021biune \u201eS\u0103 ie\u0219im la vot \u0219i s\u0103 schimb\u0103m soarta Rom\u00e2niei!\u201d, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin \u00eencercarea de a influen\u021ba aleg\u0103torii c\u0103tre candida\u021bii independen\u021bi.
