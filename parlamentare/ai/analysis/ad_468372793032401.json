The reach estimate is \">1M\", indicating a clear intention to reach a wide audience. This satisfies the condition of \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post seems to be damage control and reputation management for Dr. Josef Kopp. While indirectly related to the political climate (given the accusations), the post doesn't directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections.  The content focuses on refuting accusations, not influencing votes. Therefore, \"Article 36 (7) - c\" does not fully apply.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of self-defense or a public statement by Dr. Josef Kopp. It presents his perspective on the accusations, but it lacks the objectivity and journalistic standards expected of news reporting.

The content focuses on Dr. Josef Kopp's response to accusations against him. The presence of a byline (\"CMI \u2013 Dr Josef Kopp\") raises concerns, but the lack of direct electoral campaigning makes a definitive classification as electoral propaganda difficult.
