This indicates an attempt to reach a wide audience, not just personal communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post focuses on the lack of transparency in local council meetings and proposes a solution (online broadcasts). While seemingly beneficial, this proposal is presented in a way that subtly promotes Marian Dumitru and AUR's commitment to transparency.  The implication is that voting for AUR would lead to improved transparency. This suggests an electoral objective, even if not explicitly stated.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post presents itself as a discussion of a public issue (lack of transparency). However, the framing and the clear association with a political candidate and party push it beyond objective journalism. It lacks the neutrality expected from journalistic reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content is not a purely personal opinion. It's presented as a political statement by a candidate, using a paid advertisement to reach a wide audience.

The presence of a CMF code, the clear association with a parliamentary candidate (Marian Dumitru of AUR), the targeting of a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and the framing of the issue of transparency all point towards electoral propaganda.  The post uses a seemingly neutral topic to subtly promote the candidate and his party.  While the content itself might not be overtly promotional, the context and method of dissemination clearly indicate an attempt to influence voters.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak; the post is clearly linked to a candidate and party, uses paid advertising to reach a wide audience, and implies that voting for the candidate will result in positive change.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Marian Dumitru</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSocietatea Calarasi Hexel Press SRL, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei postari pe Facebook (ID 9515737678442617) cu continut electoral,  care, desi nu solicita explicit voturi pentru Marian Dumitru, presedintele Organizatiei Judetene AUR Calarasi, creeaza o legatura directa intre acesta si o promisiune de imbunatatire a transparentei in sedintele consiliilor locale.  Postarea, platita intre 700 si 799 RON, a atins 60.000-70.000 de impresii, avand ca tinta judetul Calarasi, si utilizeaza codul CMF 11240014, indicand clar natura electorala a mesajului.  Efectul electoral este evident, prin asocierea candidatului cu o solutie la o problema publica, sugerand ca votul pentru AUR va aduce transparenta.
