It refers to a specific candidate (implicitly Mircea Minea through his position as mayor and affiliation with PNL), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support the PNL. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content is not journalistic or a personal opinion; it's a direct appeal for votes. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Minea</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal (PNL)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMircea Minea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 2041957979608071), cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul \u00een favoarea Partidului Na\u021bional Liberal,  prin afirma\u021bii precum \u201eTrebuie s\u0103 vot\u0103m Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal\u201d \u0219i \u201eHai s\u0103 nu l\u0103s\u0103m \u021bara s\u0103 o ia razna!\u201d,  av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar pozitiv asupra candidatului Mircea Minea \u0219i PNL.
