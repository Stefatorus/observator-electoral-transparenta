The post refers to Ciprian Ivanov, the mayor of Cop\u0103l\u0103u commune. While not explicitly a parliamentary candidate, the post highlights his achievements in local governance, which could indirectly influence voters' perception of his political affiliation and capabilities.  This indirectly relates to \"Article 36 (7) - a\" as it refers to a person in a political role.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and uses hashtags (#voceabotosani #botosani #comuna_Cop\u0103l\u0103u) suggesting an intention to reach a wide audience within Boto\u0219ani County and beyond. This fulfills \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While not directly advocating for a vote for a specific parliamentary candidate, the post's positive portrayal of Ciprian Ivanov's performance as mayor could indirectly influence voters' opinions in the upcoming parliamentary elections.  The positive framing of his work could be interpreted as subtly promoting his political alignment and implicitly encouraging support for candidates from his party. This is a subjective interpretation, but the potential for indirect electoral influence is present. This relates to \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about local governance projects. However, the overwhelmingly positive tone and lack of critical analysis or counterpoints suggest a promotional rather than purely journalistic approach. The absence of journalistic standards (balance, verification, etc.) weakens this argument.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post is not a personal opinion; it's a promotional piece presented as news, but lacking journalistic objectivity. The positive portrayal of the mayor's work is not presented as a personal opinion but as factual information, which is misleading.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>2178796235854689</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly endorsing a parliamentary candidate, presents a highly favorable portrayal of a local politician, Ciprian Ivanov. This positive portrayal, disseminated through a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a wide audience in Boto\u0219ani County, could indirectly influence voters' perceptions and potentially sway their choices in the parliamentary elections. The lack of journalistic objectivity and the promotional nature of the content raise concerns about its compliance with Article 98 t).  While the post doesn't directly call for votes, the implicit endorsement through positive framing is a key concern. The targeting of specific localities within Boto\u0219ani County further strengthens the argument for indirect electoral influence.  The counter-argument is that the post focuses on local governance, not the parliamentary elections. However, the potential for indirect influence is significant enough to warrant scrutiny.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  </electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea - Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 2178796235854689), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu un buget de sub 100 RON, care prezint\u0103 o imagine extrem de pozitiv\u0103 a primarului Ciprian Ivanov din comuna Cop\u0103l\u0103u, f\u0103r\u0103 a men\u021biona vreun candidat parlamentar, dar av\u00e2nd un efect electoral indirect prin influen\u021barea percep\u021biei electoratului asupra sa \u0219i, implicit, asupra partidului s\u0103u.
