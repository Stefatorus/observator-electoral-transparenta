It directly refers to specific parliamentary candidates (parties USR, PNL, and implicitly PSD), targets a wide audience through a paid advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters' choices by creating a negative association between USR/PNL and PSD.  The post lacks journalistic integrity and presents a biased, unsubstantiated claim. The fact that it's a paid advertisement further strengthens the argument that it's intended to influence the election outcome.  The post's targeting parameters show a focus on Constan\u021ba County, suggesting a localized campaign to influence voters there.  The spend is less than RON 100, but even small amounts can have an impact.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nClaudiu-Iorga Palaz, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite (ID 615078284376981) cu mesajul \"Votezi USR sau votezi PNL = Votezi PSD!\",  care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei.
