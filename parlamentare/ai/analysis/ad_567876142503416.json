While seemingly policy-focused, the post's context (paid advertisement, self-promotion by a candidate, targeting a wide audience) and objective (enhancing the candidate's image and indirectly influencing votes) clearly align with the definition of electoral propaganda under Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. The post's timing, after the official campaign period, further strengthens this conclusion.  The post does not fall under any of the allowed categories.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Sebastian Tiberiu Pop</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Sebastian - Tiberiu Pop], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID: 567876142503416), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 o ini\u021biativ\u0103 legislativ\u0103 despre evalu\u0103ri psihologice obligatorii pentru candida\u021bi, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea imaginii \u0219i a credibilit\u0103\u021bii candidatului Sebastian Tiberiu Pop, influen\u021b\u00e2nd astfel votul aleg\u0103torilor.
