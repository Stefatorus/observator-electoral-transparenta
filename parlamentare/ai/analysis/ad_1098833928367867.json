It refers to a specific candidate (Valeriu Iftime), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support the PNL party. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content is promotional, not journalistic, and lacks the objectivity required for neutral information dissemination.  The post's call to action directly encourages voting for a specific candidate and party.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1098833928367867) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit candidatul Valeriu Iftime \u0219i Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal (PNL), \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru acesta.
