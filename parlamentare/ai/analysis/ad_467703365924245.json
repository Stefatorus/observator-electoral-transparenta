The paid nature of the advertisement, its broad reach, and the clear call to action (\"Sunday I vote!\") all point towards electoral propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but the overall message and intent are clearly aimed at influencing the election.  The targeting of specific locations with significant Hungarian populations further strengthens this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu ID-ul 467703365924245, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine mesajul \"VAS\u00c1RNAP SZAVAZOK!\",  \u00eencuraj\u00e2nd votul pentru RMDSZ \u0219i subliniind importan\u021ba particip\u0103rii electorale pentru comunitatea maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia.
