While the post is from a political party, it doesn't refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or implicitly endorse a particular candidate for the parliamentary elections. The post focuses on general issues of citizen safety and security, which are not directly tied to a specific candidate's platform in the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience in C\u00e2mpina. The language used is general and addresses concerns relevant to the entire population of the city.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post seems to be to promote the party's platform regarding citizen safety and security. While this is a political issue, the post doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for the party in the parliamentary elections.  The connection to the elections is indirect at best. The focus is on local issues, not national parliamentary elections.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about the party's proposals for improving safety in C\u00e2mpina.  It could be considered a form of self-promotion by the party, but it doesn't strictly adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity and neutrality. However, it does not directly advocate for or against any candidate.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express a personal opinion; rather, it presents the party's platform on a specific issue.  The language is formal and avoids personal opinions or subjective viewpoints.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>729235005921674</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while from a political party, does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.  The post focuses on local issues (improving safety and security in C\u00e2mpina) rather than directly advocating for votes for specific candidates in the parliamentary elections.  Although the post is from a political party and aims to improve public image, it lacks the direct call to action or explicit endorsement of a candidate required to classify it as electoral propaganda. The post does not violate Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, as it does not directly refer to a candidate, nor does it exceed the limits of journalistic information.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PCC</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
