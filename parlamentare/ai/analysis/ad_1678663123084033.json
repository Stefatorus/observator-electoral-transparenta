The post explicitly mentions Daniel Moraru, who is identified as the president of UNPR (Uniunea Na\u021bional\u0103 a Patronatului Rom\u00e2n) - Regiunea Sud-Est.

While the post doesn't explicitly call for votes for or against any candidate, the statement \"2025 nu trebuie s\u0103 fie ceva de speriat.

The context of \"aceast\u0103 halucina\u021bie electoral\u0103\" suggests a commentary on the current electoral climate, which could indirectly influence voters' choices.

However, the selection of this quote and its placement within a paid advertisement raise questions about its objectivity and journalistic intent.

While the post presents Moraru's opinion, it's presented in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a particular viewpoint on the electoral process and the future.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse or condemn any specific parliamentary candidate, the context and phrasing suggest an attempt to influence public opinion in a way that could indirectly benefit certain political actors. The quote from Daniel Moraru, presented within a paid advertisement, blurs the lines between news reporting and political campaigning. The statement about 2025 could be interpreted as a subtle attempt to shape public expectations and influence voting behavior.  The ambiguity makes a definitive conclusion challenging, but the potential for indirect electoral influence is present.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Daniel Constantin Moraru</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Tomis News</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTomis News, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID-ul post\u0103rii: 1678663123084033), cu con\u021binut ce promoveaz\u0103 indirect o perspectiv\u0103 politic\u0103 favorabil\u0103 lui Daniel Constantin Moraru, pre\u0219edintele UNPR - Regiunea Sud-Est.
