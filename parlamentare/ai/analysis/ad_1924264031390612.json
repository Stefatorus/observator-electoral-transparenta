The paid nature of the Facebook post, targeting a wide audience, further strengthens this conclusion.  While the post doesn't explicitly call for votes, its implicit endorsement of PNCR and its criticism of the current political climate clearly aims to influence voters. The argument against it being propaganda is weak; the post's design and context strongly suggest an electoral objective.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Cristian Terhes</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPop Sebastian Tiberiu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1924264031390612) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu scop electoral,  con\u021bin\u00e2nd  mesaje care promoveaz\u0103 indirect PNCR \u0219i candidatul Cristian Terhes prin utilizarea hashtag-urilor \"#pncr#cristianterhes\" \u0219i un num\u0103r CMF (CMF11240003),  av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv asupra PNCR.
