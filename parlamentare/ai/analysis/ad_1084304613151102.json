The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or affiliation.  It promotes a civic organization's initiative (\"Puterea Cet\u0103\u021benilor\"). While the initiative aims to influence political change, it doesn't endorse or oppose specific candidates participating in the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, inviting people to an online meeting.  The invitation is not directed at specific individuals but aims to reach a broader audience interested in civic engagement and political reform.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post is not to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections. It promotes a civic organization's project aimed at broader political change. While indirectly related to politics, the post doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any candidate or party in the parliamentary elections.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about a civic organization's initiative. However, it's not strictly journalistic in nature as it promotes a specific project and encourages participation. The line between advocacy and journalism is blurred here, but the primary intent seems to be promoting the organization's work, not providing objective news.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express personal opinions unrelated to the promotion of the civic organization's project. The content is focused on presenting the project and encouraging participation.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1084304613151102</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post promotes an event organized by a civic organization. While the organization's goals are politically oriented, aiming for broader societal change, the post itself does not directly advocate for or against any specific candidate or party participating in the parliamentary elections. The post does not meet the criteria of electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  It lacks direct reference to a candidate (a), its objective is not primarily electoral (c), and it doesn't fall outside the bounds of civic engagement (d).  The post's aim is to promote a civic initiative, not to influence the vote in the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>MPDD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
