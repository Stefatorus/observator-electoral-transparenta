The content is educational and aims to raise public awareness on a social issue, not to influence electoral choices.  The post does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, and therefore does not violate Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically qualify it as electoral propaganda if the content itself is not related to the elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Asocia\u021bia Necuvinte</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
