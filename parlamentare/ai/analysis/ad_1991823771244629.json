The primary objective of the post appears to be promoting a message of calm and empathy in the context of heightened political tension following the presidential elections.

The post focuses on a general call for calm and empathy, avoiding any direct endorsement or criticism of specific candidates or parties participating in the parliamentary elections.  The lack of specific candidate mention, the broad appeal for societal unity, and the overall tone suggest the post aims to express a personal opinion rather than influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections.  The post's content aligns more with citizen journalism or opinion commentary than with electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
