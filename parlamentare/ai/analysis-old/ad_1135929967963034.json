It does not mention any parliamentary candidates or parties, nor does it explicitly encourage voting for or against any specific candidate. The post's aim is to inform the public about the survey results, which is consistent with journalistic practices. While the information presented might indirectly influence voters' perceptions, it does not constitute direct electoral propaganda as defined by Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. The post does not violate Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 because it does not meet the criteria of electoral propaganda.  It lacks a direct reference to a candidate (a), its objective is not primarily electoral (c), and it falls within the bounds of journalistic reporting (d).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>European Media Connections</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
