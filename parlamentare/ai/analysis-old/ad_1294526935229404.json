The claim that PSD mayors are urging support for Georgescu to prevent Lasconi's victory is a clear attempt to manipulate public opinion during the election period. The post lacks journalistic objectivity and neutrality, instead promoting a specific candidate within the PSD.  The fact that it's a paid advertisement targeting a wide audience further strengthens the case for it being electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Calin Georgescu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Lasconi</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Fruncea</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Fruncea], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite (ID 1294526935229404) care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea lui Calin Georgescu \u0219i \u00eempotriva lui Lasconi.
