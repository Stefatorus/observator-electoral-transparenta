The post explicitly mentions and supports George Simion for President.

The primary objective is to garner support for George Simion, who is strongly associated with AUR.  While not explicitly urging a vote for specific parliamentary candidates, the post implicitly promotes AUR's platform and aims to increase positive sentiment towards the party, thereby indirectly influencing the parliamentary elections.

This indirect promotion, coupled with the paid nature of the Facebook post and its clear intention to influence voters' perceptions of AUR, constitutes electoral propaganda. The use of emotionally charged language and calls to action further solidify this conclusion.  The presence of a CMF number reinforces this assessment.  While the post doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) - a by not explicitly naming parliamentary candidates, it circumvents this by leveraging the strong association between Simion and AUR to indirectly promote the party in the context of the ongoing parliamentary elections.  The post's timing, targeting, and content all point towards an attempt to influence the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>George Simion</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAUR - S\\u0103la\\u0219u de Sus, pentru \\u00e2nc\\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\\u0103ri p\\u0103g\\u0103ndite pentru a influen\\u021ba electoratul prin promovarea indirect\\u0103 a partidului AUR \\u0219i a lui George Simion, cu scopul de a cre\\u0219te simpatia publicului fa\\u021b\\u0103 de partid \\u0219i implicit de candida\\u021bii acestuia la alegerile parlamentare, fapt eviden\\u021biat de con\\u0219inutul post\\u0103rii care face referire la George Simion ca pre\\u0219edinte \\u0219i utilizeaz\\u0103 un limbaj emo\\u021bializat pentru a convinge electoratul, precum \\u0219i prezen\\u021ba codului CMF 11240014, ID-ul post\\u0103rii pe Facebook fiind 555150543924818.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
