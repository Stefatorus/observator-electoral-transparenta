This indirectly refers to candidates from parties representing the Hungarian minority in Romania, making \"Article 36 (7) - a\" potentially applicable.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post, being a paid Facebook advertisement, is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just a select few. The targeting parameters (age, location) further confirm this.

It lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected from journalistic reporting. It's a clear call to action, promoting participation in the elections, which is not a neutral stance.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The quote from Bishop B\u00f6cskei is presented as a statement of fact, not a personal opinion.

This indirect endorsement, coupled with the paid advertisement format and targeting, constitutes electoral propaganda. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) is not specified in the provided data, but if it falls outside the legal timeframe, it would further strengthen the case for a violation.  The absence of a CMF number weakens the direct link to a specific campaign, but doesn't negate the overall impact as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Candidates representing the Hungarian minority (UDMR and potentially others)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Bihar Megye, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 941584470896784) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, \u00eendeamn\u0103 indirect comunitatea maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia s\u0103 voteze, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar pozitiv asupra candida\u021bilor care reprezint\u0103 interesele acestei comunit\u0103\u021bi.
