The post explicitly mentions Gheorghe Simon, a PSD candidate for the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a wide audience within Maramures County and surrounding areas, as evidenced by the targeting data in the `aaa_info` section. The language used (\"Dragii mei vi\u0219euani, dragi maramure\u0219eni\") also indicates an attempt to reach a broad audience.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to support Gheorghe Simon (PSD) in the parliamentary elections.  Phrases like \"Duminic\u0103, la alegerile parlamentare, sus\u021binem omul nostru\" and  \"sus\u021binem vi\u0219euianul nostru-Gheorghe Simon \u0219i PSD Maramure\u0219\" clearly demonstrate an intention to influence the election outcome.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents some general statements about community unity and the importance of elections, its core message is a direct endorsement of a specific candidate. It lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post is not expressing a personal opinion; it's a clear and direct call to action to vote for a specific candidate. The mayor's position adds weight to the endorsement, making it more than a personal opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>465702052796693</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by Prim\u00e1ria Vi\u0219eu de Sus, fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It directly refers to a specific candidate (Gheorghe Simon, PSD), targets a wide audience in Maramure\u0219 County, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for Simon), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The post's timing, close to the election day, further strengthens the case for it being electoral propaganda.  The post's content is not educational or journalistic in nature; it is explicitly promotional.  The fact that it is a paid advertisement on a public platform like Facebook reinforces its nature as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Gheorghe Simon</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPrim\u00e1ria Vi\u0219eu de Sus, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 465702052796693) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Gheorghe Simon (PSD) la alegerile parlamentare, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
