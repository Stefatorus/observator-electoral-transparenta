While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being considered electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to a specific candidate's official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post refers to Daniel Moraru, who is identified as the president of UNPR (Uniunea Na\u021bional\u0103 a Patronatului Rom\u00e2n) - Regiunea Sud-Est.  However, it's crucial to note that UNPR is not listed among the parliamentary candidates in the provided list. The post mentions the \"electoral hallucination,\" suggesting a connection to the political climate, but doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose any parliamentary candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.  It's clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just a select few individuals. The use of hashtags and the sharing on a public news page further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's primary objective appears to be expressing an opinion on the current political climate and calling for calm amidst what Moraru describes as an \"electoral hallucination.\" While it touches upon the electoral context, it doesn't directly advocate for or against any specific parliamentary candidate. The call for calm and a focus on the future (2025) is not a direct call to vote for or against anyone.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of citizen journalism, reporting on Moraru's statement.  Tomis News, as a news outlet, is presenting information, not directly influencing the vote. The post links to a longer article on their website, suggesting a journalistic approach to reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Moraru's statement, as presented by Tomis News, expresses a personal opinion about the political situation.  While the context is electoral, the content itself doesn't directly influence voters to choose a specific candidate. It's more of a commentary on the overall political atmosphere.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1678663123084033</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while published during an electoral period and referencing the political climate, does not directly promote or discourage voting for any specific parliamentary candidate.  The statement by Daniel Moraru expresses his opinion on the situation, but it lacks the explicit call to action characteristic of electoral propaganda. The post primarily functions as news reporting by Tomis News, a media outlet.  While the subject matter is political, the presentation and intent do not appear to violate Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Tomis News</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
