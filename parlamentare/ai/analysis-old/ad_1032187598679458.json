This indirectly refers to candidates running under the PNL banner in the local elections, even if not explicitly named.

The objective is clearly to influence voters in favor of the PNL in Leorda. While it doesn't name specific parliamentary candidates, the strong association with the PNL and the clear intent to influence voting behavior make it electoral propaganda. The timing of the post (after the parliamentary election period) is not specified in the provided data, but if it falls outside the allowed period, it would be a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime (and other members of #EchipaValeriuIftime)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Na\u021bional Liberal - filiala Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1032187598679458) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 echipa #EchipaValeriuIftime, puternic asociat\u0103 cu PNL Leorda, prin imagini \u0219i text, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea candida\u021bilor PNL din Leorda.
