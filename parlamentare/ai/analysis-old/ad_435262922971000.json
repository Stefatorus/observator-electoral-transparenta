It directly promotes specific candidates (ANC for Parliament and C\u01celin Georgescu for Presidency) and explicitly urges voters to support them. The paid nature of the post, its wide reach, and its clear objective to influence voting behavior all point towards a violation of Article 98 t).  The post's content goes beyond informing the public; it actively campaigns for specific candidates.  The argument that it's simply expressing an opinion is weak, given the direct call to action and the targeting of a large audience.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>ANC</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>C\u01celin Georgescu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FreeInfo</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFreeInfo, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 435262922971000) care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la votarea Alian\u021bei Na\u021bionale Cre\u0219tine (ANC) pentru Parlamentul Rom\u00e2niei \u0219i a lui C\u01celin Georgescu pentru Pre\u0219edin\u021bia Rom\u00e2niei.
