The post's language (\"Hai la vot... Vot\u0103m echipa PNL...\") is explicitly promotional and lacks any journalistic or informational value. The targeting parameters indicate an attempt to reach a wide audience within a specific geographical area.  While the post doesn't include a CMF number, the clear intent to influence the election outcome makes it highly likely to be considered electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post (assuming it was published after the official campaign period ended) further strengthens this assessment.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Jitaru Ovidiu], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit candidatul Valeriu Iftime \u0219i Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal (PNL), \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru ace\u0219tia cu fraza \"Hai la vot pe 1 decembrie!
