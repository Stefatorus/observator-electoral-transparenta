The paid promotion simply increases the reach of this public safety message.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 and is not in violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
