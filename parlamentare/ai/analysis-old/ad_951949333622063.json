This is not necessarily indicative of a violation, as CMF numbers are associated with candidates, and this post is from a non-candidate entity.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any specific parliamentary candidate by name or affiliation. The link leads to a website (\"eucucinevotez.eu\") which may contain political content, but the Facebook post itself lacks direct reference to any candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.  It is therefore intended to reach a wide audience, not just a specific individual or small group.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The objective of the post is unclear from the text alone. The phrase \"Ne uit\u0103m la ce fac politicienii, nu doar la ce zic ace\u0219tia\" (\"We look at what politicians do, not just what they say\") suggests a focus on evaluating politicians' actions. However, without knowing the content of the linked website, it's impossible to definitively determine if the post aims to influence voting behavior. The post could be interpreted as encouraging informed voting, which is not prohibited.  However, the linked website's content is crucial for a complete assessment.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post's style and language are not strictly journalistic.  It's more of a promotional message directing users to a website. While the statement about observing politicians' actions could be considered a form of political commentary, it lacks the depth and neutrality typically associated with journalistic reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; rather, it promotes a website.  The statement about observing politicians' actions is a general statement, not a personal opinion on a specific candidate or party.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>951949333622063</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe analysis reveals that the Facebook post itself does not directly violate Article 98 t). It does not explicitly endorse or oppose any candidate, nor does it provide advice on voting at polling stations. The post's ambiguity lies in the linked website, \"eucucinevotez.eu,\" whose content remains unknown.  If the website contains electoral propaganda, the post could be considered indirectly promoting such propaganda. However, without access to the website's content, it's impossible to definitively classify the post as electoral propaganda.  In dubio pro reo, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the advertiser.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>DifinePR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
