The post does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the election.  While the post is paid for and has a wide reach, its objective is not to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Ludovic Orban</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Liviu Petrina</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PN\u021aMM</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
