It refers directly to a specific candidate (Valeriu Iftime) and party (PNL), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for PNL), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing is also crucial; even if the exact date isn't specified, the context strongly suggests it's related to the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Dorohoi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 925633439092773) care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru PNL \u0219i Valeriu Iftime,  cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor prin \u00eendemnuri directe precum \u201eAvem nevoie de toat\u0103 mobilizarea pentru alegerile parlamentare\u201d, \u201eDoar aleg\u00e2nd #EchipaValeriuIftime, echipa PNL, putem schimba ceva\u201d, \u0219i \u201ePozi\u021bia 1 pe buletinul de vot\u201d,  ignor\u00e2nd astfel restric\u021biile legale privind continuarea propagandei electorale dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale.
