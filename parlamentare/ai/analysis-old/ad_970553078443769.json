The post mentions several candidates by their party affiliation (PSD, AUR, USR, PNL) and one independent candidate (C\u0103lin Georgescu).  While not naming them explicitly, the context clearly refers to them as participants in the Dolj County elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed for wide public reach. The phrasing \"Vezi cum s-au descurcat \u00een Dolj candida\u021bii...\" (See how the candidates fared in Dolj...) indicates an intention to inform a broad audience, not just a select few.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While the post claims to present information on election results, the title \"Lasconi, victorie surpriz\u0103 \u00een fieful Olgu\u021bei\" (Lasconi, surprise victory in Olgu\u021ba's stronghold) suggests a narrative that could influence voters' perceptions of the candidates. The use of \"victorie surpriz\u0103\" (surprise victory) is emotionally charged and could sway public opinion. The post aims to generate interest in the election results, which could indirectly influence future voting behavior.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about election results, which is a journalistic function. However, the framing of the information, particularly the title, leans towards opinion and potentially biased reporting rather than objective journalism. The lack of detailed analysis or factual data beyond the headline further weakens its journalistic claim.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it presents information in a manner that could be interpreted as biased reporting or propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>970553078443769</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post walks a fine line. It reports on election results, which could be considered journalistic. However, the emotionally charged title and the focus on a \"surprise victory\" strongly suggest an intention to influence voters' perceptions. The targeting of Dolj County, combined with the mention of specific parties and an independent candidate, further strengthens the argument that this is electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number is not conclusive evidence against it being propaganda, as the responsible party might not be a candidate themselves.  The post's objective seems to be to generate interest and potentially influence future voting behavior, even if indirectly.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Elena-Valerica Lasconi</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Olgu\u021ba Vasilescu</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>C\u0103lin Georgescu</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSC INDISCRET MEDIA SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri (ID 970553078443769) cu titlul sugestiv \u201eLasconi, victorie surpriz\u0103 \u00een fieful Olgu\u021bei\u201d, care, de\u0219i pretinde a prezenta rezultate electorale din jude\u021bul Dolj, utilizeaz\u0103 un limbaj emo\u021bional \u0219i o prezentare tenden\u021bioas\u0103 pentru a influen\u021ba percep\u021bia publicului asupra candida\u021bilor Elena-Valerica Lasconi (pozitiv), Olgu\u021ba Vasilescu (negativ) \u0219i C\u0103lin Georgescu (neutru), men\u021bion\u00e2nd explicit partidele PSD, AUR, USR \u0219i PNL.
