The post refers to \"Sigheti\", implicitly referring to a candidate, although not naming them directly.  The context strongly suggests this is a political opponent of the poster, Ioan Turcin.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed for wide public reach. The content addresses issues relevant to the community of Paulis.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While not explicitly advocating for or against a specific candidate by name, the post strongly criticizes the actions of \"Sigheti\" regarding tax reduction, framing it as a betrayal of promises made during the campaign. This could be interpreted as an attempt to influence voters' opinions negatively towards \"Sigheti\" and potentially positively towards Ioan Turcin, who is identified as the author of the post. The timing of the post, close to the election, further strengthens this interpretation.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents information, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. It is clearly biased, using emotionally charged language (\"bate joc,\" \"v\u00e2nz\u0103tor de iluzii,\" \"a\u021bi prostit oamenii,\" \"le-a\u021bi \u00eentors spatele oamenilor,\" \"e ru\u0219inos\") to discredit \"Sigheti.\"  The purpose is not to inform neutrally but to persuade.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While presented as a personal opinion, the post goes beyond expressing a viewpoint. It uses strong accusations and emotionally charged language to sway public opinion against a political opponent, exceeding the bounds of personal commentary and entering the realm of political campaigning.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>579099107818696</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly mentioning a specific candidate's name, strongly criticizes \"Sigheti,\" who is implied to be a political opponent of Ioan Turcin. The post uses emotionally charged language and accusations to negatively portray \"Sigheti's\" actions regarding tax reduction, potentially influencing voters' opinions. The timing of the post, close to the election, and its paid nature on a public platform suggest an intention to sway public opinion.  While the image is unrelated to the text, the paid nature of the post and its clear political intent make it likely to be considered electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number does not automatically exclude it, as the law does not explicitly require it for all forms of political advertising.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Sigheti</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Ioan Turcin</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nIoan Turcin, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 579099107818696) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine critici vehemente la adresa lui \u201eSigheti\u201d,  implicat implicit \u00eentr-un context electoral, utiliz\u00e2nd un limbaj emo\u021bional \u0219i acuza\u021bii menite s\u0103 influen\u021beze negativ opinia public\u0103 fa\u021b\u0103 de acesta,  \u00een beneficiul lui Ioan Turcin, autorul post\u0103rii.
