This implicitly refers to all PNL candidates in the Boto\u0219ani area.

The targeting includes numerous cities in Boto\u0219ani County, indicating an intention to reach a wide audience, not just individuals. Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's message (\"Agricultura. Motorul jude\u021bului Boto\u0219ani!\") promotes a positive image of the PNL's approach to agriculture in Boto\u0219ani.  The hashtag \"#continu\u0103mSchimbarea\" (\"we continue the change\") directly links this message to the PNL's political platform and implicitly encourages voters to support them.  The objective is clearly to influence voters positively towards the PNL.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c applies.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post is not journalistic in nature. While it touches upon a topic of public interest (agriculture), it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. It's presented as a promotional message, not an informative piece.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The content is not a personal opinion; it's a carefully crafted message designed to promote a political party and its policies. The use of hashtags and the CMF number further reinforces this.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1517892218924770</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It refers implicitly to PNL candidates, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (positive influence on voters), and is not journalistic in nature. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its status as electoral propaganda.  The only potential argument against it being propaganda would be the lack of explicit mention of a specific candidate, but the implicit association with the PNL is strong enough to outweigh this.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>All PNL candidates in Boto\u0219ani</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPNL Boto\u0219ani - Organizatia Municipala, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1517892218924770) cu con\u021binut electoral,  care promoveaz\u0103 implicit candida\u021bii PNL din jude\u021bul Boto\u0219ani prin mesajul \u201eAgricultura.
