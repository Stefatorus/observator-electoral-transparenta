It refers to a specific candidate (Sebastian Tiberiu Pop), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by the end date), has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's targeting parameters (age, location) also suggest a deliberate attempt to influence voters.  There are no counterarguments to suggest otherwise.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Sebastian Tiberiu Pop</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103 de postare], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 452313740908308) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Sebastian Tiberiu Pop pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea PNCR.
