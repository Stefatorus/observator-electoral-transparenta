It directly refers to the author, Sebastian Tiberiu Pop, a candidate for a public office, and aims to influence voters' perception of his competence and responsibility. The paid nature of the post, its broad reach, and persuasive language all point towards an intention to sway public opinion in favor of the candidate.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.  While the post doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for him, the implicit message is clear: supporting this policy proposal is tantamount to supporting the candidate himself.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Sebastian Tiberiu Pop</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Responsabilul Sebastian Tiberiu Pop], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1289211355428130) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i prezentat\u0103 ca o propunere legislativ\u0103, constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103.
