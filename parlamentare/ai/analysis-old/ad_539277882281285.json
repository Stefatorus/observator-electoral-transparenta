It refers to a candidate (Valeriu Iftime), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by \"alegerile parlamentare de duminica aceasta\"), has an electoral objective (to positively influence voters' perception of Iftime and his team), and goes beyond journalistic reporting by being overtly promotional. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's targeting of a wide geographical area in Boto\u0219ani County and beyond confirms its intention to reach a broad audience.  There are no counterarguments to suggest this is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 539277882281285) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 pe Valeriu Iftime, pre\u0219edintele PNL Boto\u0219ani, \u00een contextul alegerilor parlamentare, folosind un limbaj laudativ \u0219i eviden\u021biind calit\u0103\u021bile sale \u0219i ale echipei sale, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
