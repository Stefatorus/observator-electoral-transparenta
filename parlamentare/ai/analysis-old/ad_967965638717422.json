It refers directly to a specific parliamentary candidate (AUR), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to choose AUR. The post's content is not journalistic or a personal opinion; it's a direct endorsement.  The timing of the post, considering the provided end date, is crucial. If the post was published after the official end of the electoral campaign period, it would constitute a violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor (AUR)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Ciprian Paraschiv</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nCiprian Paraschiv, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (data de \u00eencheiere a campaniei electorale), cu mesajul explicit \u201eVot\u0103m AUR!\u201d,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea partidului AUR,  constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei, conform legisla\u021biei \u00een vigoare.
