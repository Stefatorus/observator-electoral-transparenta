While the post is clearly related to the RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania) party and encourages voting, it does not specifically mention any individual candidate by name or other identifying information.  The post focuses on the party's overall platform and the importance of voting for the Hungarian community.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, specifically the Hungarian-speaking population in Romania. The targeting parameters further support this, focusing on specific regions with significant Hungarian populations.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to participate in the election and implicitly support the RMDSZ. The message emphasizes the importance of Hungarian representation and the potential consequences of not voting.  The phrasing \"I'm voting because...\" directly appeals to voters' sense of civic duty and party loyalty.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It presents a partisan viewpoint, urging voters to support the RMDSZ, and does not offer balanced information or diverse perspectives.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post includes personal statements (\"I want my children...\"), these are used to bolster the party's message and encourage voting, not to express a purely personal opinion unrelated to the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1112562726903906</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while not explicitly mentioning individual candidates, constitutes electoral propaganda. It promotes the RMDSZ party by encouraging voting and highlighting the importance of Hungarian representation in Romania. The paid advertisement on a public platform, targeting specific regions with significant Hungarian populations, clearly aims to influence voters' choices. The post's content, focusing on the party's platform and the consequences of not voting, directly serves an electoral objective.  While it doesn't violate Article 36 (7) - a) by not naming specific candidates, it fulfills criteria b), c), and d). The post is clearly electoral material used during the campaign period (b), has an electoral objective (c), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting (d).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1112562726903906), dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru RMDSZ,  folosind mesaje precum \u201epentru asta votez\u201d,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea aleg\u0103torilor din jude\u021bele Harghita, Covasna \u0219i Mure\u0219,  \u00een favoarea partidului,  constituind astfel propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale.
