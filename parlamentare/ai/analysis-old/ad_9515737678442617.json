While seemingly a non-partisan issue, the context of the post, linked to a candidate from AUR, suggests an electoral objective.

The overall aim is to present the candidate in a positive light, implicitly influencing voters' perception. This fulfills \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks objectivity and presents a one-sided perspective on the need for online broadcasts, framing it as a solution easily achievable with minimal cost.

The presence of a CMF code confirms its connection to an electoral campaign. The paid Facebook advertisement targets a wide audience in Calarasi County.  The post's content, while seemingly about transparency, serves an electoral objective by positively framing the candidate.  It does not meet the criteria of journalistic reporting.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Marian Dumitru</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSocietatea Calarasi Hexel Press SRL, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei postari pe Facebook (ID 9515737678442617) cu continut electoral, care promoveaza indirect candidatul Marian Dumitru de la AUR prin prezentarea unei propuneri de politica publica,  avand ca efect electoral cresterea popularitatii si a imaginii sale pozitive in randul alegatorilor din judetul Calarasi. Prezenta codului CMF 11240014 confirma legatura directa cu campania electorala.  Postarea, desi aparent neutrala, serveste unui obiectiv electoral, nefiind o informare jurnalistica obiectiva.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
