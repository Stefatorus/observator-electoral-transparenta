            "text": "<output>\n<analysis>\n<has-cmf>The post includes a CMF number (CMF11240003) at the end. This strongly suggests an intention to engage in electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are typically used by candidates or their representatives to comply with legal requirements for campaign materials.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate by name, it heavily implies a preference against the PSD-PNL-USR alliance.  It uses numerical data to suggest that this alliance has a significant advantage and that other candidates (implicitly including the author) are at a disadvantage. This indirectly refers to all candidates within the mentioned alliance, and thus, it can be considered as referring to candidates.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook post, clearly intended for a wide audience. The language used (\"rom\u00e2ni,\" \"voi,\" \"fiecare dintre voi\") and the call to action (\"ie\u0219i\u021bi la vot\") all indicate an attempt to reach a broad segment of the population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to influence voters' choices in the upcoming parliamentary elections.  The post presents a stark comparison between the voting power of the PSD-PNL-USR alliance and other candidates, urging readers to vote to prevent the alliance from gaining control. This is a clear attempt to sway public opinion and increase votes for candidates outside the mentioned alliance.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. While it presents some numerical data, it lacks objectivity and is clearly biased towards a particular outcome. The emotional language, appeals to fear (\"Nu l\u0103sa\u021bi pe nimeni s\u0103 v\u0103 fure speran\u021ba!\"), and the explicit call to action (\"ie\u0219i\u021bi la vot\") all point to a clear intention to influence the vote, rather than simply inform.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post is not a simple expression of personal opinion. While it presents some opinions, it uses these opinions to directly advocate for a specific electoral outcome. The numerical data and the call to action are not merely expressions of personal belief but rather strategic attempts to influence the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1130310645194385</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post fulfills all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006. It refers indirectly to parliamentary candidates (by mentioning the PSD-PNL-USR alliance), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook post, has a clear electoral objective (influencing voters to vote against the mentioned alliance), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by using emotional appeals and a direct call to action.  The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing, close to election day, also increases the likelihood of it being considered electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Pop Sebastian Tiberiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPop Sebastian Tiberiu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook cu ID-ul 1130310645194385 dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 prin prezentarea unor date numerice tenden\u021bioase pentru a influen\u021ba votul \u00eempotriva alian\u021bei PSD-PNL-USR,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral manipularea opiniei publice \u0219i \u00eendemnul direct la vot \u00eempotriva acestei alian\u021be, fapt ce contravine prevederilor legale privind interzicerea propagandei electorale dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale.
