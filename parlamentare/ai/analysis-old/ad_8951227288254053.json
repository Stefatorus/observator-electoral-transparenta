Given that it's a paid advertisement featuring the candidate's name and is targeted towards a wide audience in his electoral region, it can be interpreted as a form of indirect electoral propaganda. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) is a crucial factor.  The absence of a CMF number is not conclusive, as the law doesn't explicitly mandate it for all forms of electoral propaganda. However, the overall context and intent strongly suggest an attempt to influence the election outcome.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>MOMENTUM MOTION PICTURES SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"Votul rom\u00e2nilor nu trebuie s\u0103 fie f\u0103cut la \u00eent\u00e2mplare...\", care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 explicit la votarea lui Manolache Vasile, promoveaz\u0103 indirect candidatura acestuia prin asocierea numelui s\u0103u cu un \u00eendemn la participarea la vot, viz\u00e2nd o audien\u021b\u0103 larg\u0103 \u00een jude\u021bul Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea particip\u0103rii la vot, beneficiind implicit candidatul Manolache Vasile.
