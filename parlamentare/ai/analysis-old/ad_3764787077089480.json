While the absence of a CMF number is not automatically disqualifying, it suggests the post might not be directly linked to a specific candidate's official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions UDMR (Uniunea Democrat\u0103 Maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia), a political party.  However, it doesn't explicitly refer to a specific candidate within that party by name or other identifying information. The hashtag #alegevoceara\u021biunii translates to \"choose the voice of the union\" which is a general call to vote for the party, not a specific candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The use of hashtags further suggests an attempt to reach a broader segment of the population interested in the UDMR.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's message (\"The state has become a burden for all of us\") is a general criticism of the government, not a specific policy proposal. While it could be interpreted as implicitly supporting the UDMR's platform, it doesn't explicitly urge voters to support a particular candidate or even the party itself. The hashtag #alegevoceara\u021biunii is a general call to action, not a direct endorsement of a specific candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of political commentary or opinion piece, expressing a viewpoint on the state of affairs. However, it lacks the objectivity and factual basis typically associated with journalistic reporting.  It's more of an opinion piece than a news report.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post expresses a general opinion about the state's burden on citizens. While it's politically charged, it doesn't directly advocate for or against any specific candidate or party beyond the implicit support for UDMR through the hashtag.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3764787077089480</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while politically charged and published by the UDMR, does not explicitly advocate for or against any specific candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  The message is a general criticism of the government, and the hashtag is a general call to action for the party, not a specific candidate. While the connection to UDMR is clear, the lack of direct candidate endorsement and the general nature of the message make it difficult to definitively classify it as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
