It refers to a specific candidate (Brian Cristian), is clearly intended for a wide audience (paid Facebook ad), has an explicitly electoral objective (promoting his candidacy), and does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The post's end date (1732867200) corresponds to November 23, 2024, after 18:00, which is after the official end of the electoral campaign period.  Therefore, it violates Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR Maramures</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 2308499799504251) cu scop electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Brian Cristian, con\u021bin\u00e2nd afirma\u021bii precum \u201eInforma\u021bi-v\u0103 corect c\u00e2nd v\u0103 alege\u021bi parlamentarii\u201d \u0219i \u201es\u0103 avem o Rom\u00e2nia pentru to\u021bi, nu doar pentru unii!\u201d,  precum \u0219i eviden\u021bierea realiz\u0103rilor sale legislative, toate acestea av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea candidatului men\u021bionat, \u00een clar\u0103 \u00eenc\u0103lcare a prevederilor legale privind \u00eencetarea campaniei electorale.
