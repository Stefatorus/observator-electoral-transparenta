There is no CMF number present in the provided post.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any specific candidate by name or surname. However, it strongly implies support for the UDMR (Union of Democratic Hungarians in Romania) by using their logo and being posted from their official page.  The text promotes voting for representatives who are pro-Europe and against extremism, aligning with the UDMR's platform. This indirect reference could be considered a reference to the party's candidates.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and the message is clearly intended for a wide audience, not just a select few. The use of multiple languages (Romanian and Hungarian) further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be influencing voters to support the UDMR in the parliamentary elections. The call to action (\"Pe 1 decembrie, sprijini\u021bi-ne cu votul dumneavoastr\u0103, alege\u021bi vocea ra\u021biunii!\") directly encourages voting for the party. The content frames the election as a choice between pro-European forces and extremism, implicitly positioning the UDMR as the pro-European choice.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post touches upon political issues, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It presents a biased perspective, advocating for a specific political party and framing the election in a way that favors the UDMR. It does not present multiple viewpoints or offer balanced information.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it promotes a specific political agenda and encourages voters to support a particular party. The language used is persuasive and aimed at swaying public opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1118190939907017</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly naming candidates, strongly promotes the UDMR and encourages voters to support them in the parliamentary elections.  The call to action, the framing of the election as a choice between pro-European and extremist forces, and the use of the UDMR's logo all point towards an intention to influence the vote. The post's timing (close to election day) further strengthens this interpretation.  While it doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) - a by not naming candidates, it clearly fulfills criteria b, c, and d.  The argument against it being journalism is strong.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle is not applicable here, as the evidence strongly suggests an intention to influence the vote.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>UDMR Candidates</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTemes Megyei RMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1118190939907017) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 indirect, dar evident, candida\u021bii UDMR la alegerile parlamentare, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot prin fraze precum \u201ePe 1 decembrie, sprijini\u021bi-ne cu votul dumneavoastr\u0103, alege\u021bi vocea ra\u021biunii!\u201d,  cre\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv pentru UDMR.
