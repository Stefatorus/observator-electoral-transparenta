While not explicitly calling for votes, the context, targeting, and the link to her official page strongly suggest an electoral objective. The advertisement fulfills the criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006: it refers to a specific candidate (a), targets a wide audience (c), and has an electoral objective (c).  The absence of a CMF number is not decisive, given the other strong indicators of electoral propaganda.  The post's end date (1732867200) needs to be checked against the official end date of the electoral campaign to determine if it violates Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. If the post ran after the legal end date of the campaign, it would be a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RALUCA GIORGIANA DUMITRESCU</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRaluca Giorgiana Dumitrescu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1120928716120960, care promoveaz\u0103 activitatea sa parlamentar\u0103 \u0219i con\u021bine un link c\u0103tre pagina sa de pe site-ul Camerei Deputa\u021bilor, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea vizibilit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i a popularit\u0103\u021bii sale \u00een r\u00e2ndul aleg\u0103torilor din jude\u021bul Ialomi\u021ba.
