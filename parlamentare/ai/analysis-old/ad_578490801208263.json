It explicitly mentions a candidate (Marian Dumitru), is clearly intended for a wide audience (paid Facebook ad targeting Calarasi County), and has the explicit objective of influencing the vote in favor of AUR. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as electoral propaganda.  The post's content goes beyond simple information; it's a direct appeal for votes.  The end date of the ad (1732953600) needs to be checked against the official end date of the electoral campaign to determine if it violates Article 98 t) regarding the continuation of electoral propaganda after its conclusion.  If the campaign has ended, this post is a clear violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>MARIAN DUMITRU</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSocietatea Calarasi Hexel Press SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame electorale pe Facebook (ID postare: 578490801208263) care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Marian Dumitru de la AUR, cu mesajul explicit \u201eVota\u021bi AUR \u2013 viitorul apar\u021bine celor curajo\u0219i!\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea AUR, fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei electorale, conform Legii nr. 334/2006, art. 36 (7), \u0219i prezen\u021ba CMF-ului 11240014.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
