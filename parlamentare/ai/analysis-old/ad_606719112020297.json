While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific candidate by name or party affiliation, it strongly implies a connection to Mara Tog\u0103nel, who is running for office. The post uses \"I\" and \"me\" and refers to her as a person who has the trust of 47,000 people from Mure\u0219.  This implicitly identifies her as a candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The message is not a private communication but a public appeal to voters in Mure\u0219 County.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to go to the polls on election day. While it doesn't explicitly endorse Mara Tog\u0103nel, the implicit connection and the call to action strongly suggest an electoral objective. The phrasing \"Indiferent pe cine alegi, f\u0103-\u021bi vocea auzit\u0103\" (Regardless of who you choose, make your voice heard) is a subtle but effective way to encourage participation in the election, which benefits the candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It's a personal appeal from a candidate, not an unbiased news report or analysis.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses personal beliefs (\"Cred \u00een Dumnezeu. Cred \u00een mure\u0219eni\"), these are used to bolster the call to action, making it primarily an electoral message rather than a personal opinion piece.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>606719112020297</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while not explicitly mentioning a specific party or candidate's name, strongly promotes Mara Tog\u0103nel's candidacy through implicit association and a call to action encouraging voters to participate in the election.  The post's paid nature, wide reach, and clear intention to influence voter turnout make it a form of electoral propaganda.  The statement \"Nu sunt sluga niciunui sistem. Sunt omul \u00een care peste 47.000 de mure\u0219eni \u0219i-au pus \u00eencrederea\" (I am not a servant of any system. I am the person in whom over 47,000 people from Mure\u0219 have placed their trust) is particularly suggestive of a political campaign.  The call to vote, while seemingly neutral, serves to benefit the candidate's chances.  The post's timing, close to election day, further strengthens the argument that it constitutes electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Mara Tog\u0103nel</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMara Tog\u0103nel, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 606719112020297) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un partid sau un candidat, promoveaz\u0103 implicit candidatura sa prin asociere \u0219i un apel la ac\u021biune care \u00eencurajeaz\u0103 aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 participe la alegeri.
