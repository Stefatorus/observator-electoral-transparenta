There is no CMF number present in the provided post information.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"Marcel\", which could refer to a political figure, but doesn't explicitly name a parliamentary candidate.  The context suggests a negative sentiment towards this individual, but without further information, it's impossible to definitively link \"Marcel\" to a specific candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not clearly apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, targeting a wide audience within Cara\u0219-Severin County, Romania.  The reach estimate is 100K-500K, indicating a broad dissemination intended to reach more than just a few individuals. This fulfills the requirement of addressing the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The objective is unclear. While the post expresses negative sentiment towards someone named \"Marcel,\" it doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any specific candidate in the parliamentary elections. The connection to the parliamentary elections is tenuous at best.  The post could be interpreted as expressing a general opinion, rather than having a direct electoral objective. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c is not clearly met.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. It lacks factual information, analysis, or a balanced perspective. It's primarily an expression of opinion, lacking the objectivity expected in journalistic reporting. It's not educational or informative regarding the electoral process.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post appears to express a personal or local opinion about a political figure (\"Marcel\").  While negative, it doesn't directly advocate for or against a specific candidate in the parliamentary elections. The lack of explicit call to action or endorsement suggests it's more of a personal opinion than electoral propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1372085943774850</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while politically charged and expressing negative sentiment, does not clearly meet the criteria for electoral propaganda under Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.  It lacks a clear reference to a specific parliamentary candidate, a direct call to action influencing the vote, and doesn't adhere to journalistic standards.  The connection to the parliamentary elections is indirect and tenuous. While the post is politically themed, it's more akin to an expression of personal opinion than a targeted attempt to influence the outcome of the elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
