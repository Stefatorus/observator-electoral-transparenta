While the RMDSZ logo is present, the post itself does not advocate for any specific candidate or party in the parliamentary elections. The content focuses solely on informing the public about the availability of services, not influencing their electoral choices. The presence of the RMDSZ logo alone is insufficient to classify this as electoral propaganda, especially considering the lack of any direct or indirect endorsement of a candidate.  The post does not meet the criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, as it lacks an electoral objective and does not exceed the limits of informative communication.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Eurotrans Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
