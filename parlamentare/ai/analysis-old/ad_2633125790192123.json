The post's paid nature, targeted reach, and explicit call to action (\"Vota\u021bi Dorin Curtean\") strongly suggest it's electoral propaganda. The post's content and objective directly aim to influence the election results.  While lacking a CMF number, the other elements overwhelmingly point towards a violation.  The timing of the post (assuming it's after the official campaign period) further strengthens this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Dorin Curtean</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInternational Studio, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul independent Dorin Curtean, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 voteze pentru acesta \u0219i specific\u00e2nd pozi\u021bia sa pe buletinul de vot (\"pozi\u021bia 40\"), av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia, fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei electorale.
