While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being considered electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to an official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"Mihai Poli\u021beanu,\" but doesn't explicitly refer to him as a candidate for any specific election. The content focuses on a discussion with florists regarding illegal constructions and the need for demolition. While Mihai Poli\u021beanu might hold a public office (implied by the post), the content itself doesn't directly promote his candidacy for any election.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The message is not a private communication but rather a public statement regarding a local issue.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post appears to be to inform the public about an action taken regarding illegal constructions.  There's no explicit call to vote for or against Mihai Poli\u021beanu in any election. The connection to his political role is indirect and doesn't serve as a direct electoral appeal.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of citizen journalism, reporting on a local issue. It presents information about a meeting and a decision made, without overtly advocating for a particular political outcome.  The style is more akin to a news update than a campaign advertisement.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post expresses an opinion on the need to respect the law and demolish illegal constructions. This is presented as a statement of policy or action, not as a personal opinion intended to sway votes in an election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1088204942541669</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while paid for by Mihai Poli\u021beanu and published on his Facebook page, does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The content focuses on a local issue (illegal constructions) and doesn't directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections.  The connection to Poli\u021beanu's political role is incidental, not the primary purpose of the advertisement.  The post lacks the explicit electoral objective and direct reference to a candidate required by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334/2006.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
