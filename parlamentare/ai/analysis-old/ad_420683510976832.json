It directly refers to a specific candidate (\"#EchipaValeriuIftime!\"), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has a clear electoral objective (influencing voters to support the mentioned team).  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to negate these factors.  The post's call to action (\"Pe 1 decembrie, vot\u0103m...\") directly encourages voting for a specific entity.  The content is not journalistic in nature; it's purely promotional.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Echipa Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nNeni\u021bic\u0103 Andrei, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 420683510976832, care promoveaz\u0103 explicit \"#EchipaValeriuIftime!\" \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot cu fraza \"Pe 1 decembrie, vot\u0103m #EchipaValeriuIftime!
