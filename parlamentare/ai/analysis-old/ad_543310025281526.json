It uses a paid Facebook advertisement to promote Ilie Bolojan and the PNL. The timing, messaging, and the use of a paid advertisement all point towards an attempt to influence voters in favor of the PNL.  The absence of a CMF number does not negate this, as the post clearly targets the political sphere and aims to influence electoral outcomes.  The argument that it's a personal opinion is weak, given the clear political context and the use of paid advertising to amplify the message.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Ilie Bolojan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Na\u021bional Liberal - Filiala Hunedoara, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 543310025281526) care promoveaz\u0103 pe Ilie Bolojan \u0219i Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal, cu mesajul \"Atunci nu a fost s\u0103 fie, DAR AST\u0102ZI ESTE MOMENTUL!\",  av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a voturilor \u00een favoarea PNL.
