The post does not promote or discourage voting for any specific candidate in the parliamentary elections. Its primary aim is to inform the public about a local political issue, which falls under the scope of journalistic reporting.  The absence of any reference to parliamentary candidates, coupled with the objective tone and focus on local governance, prevents it from being classified as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Indiscret in Oltenia</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
