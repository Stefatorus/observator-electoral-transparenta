The content is educational and aims to raise public awareness on a social issue, not to influence voting behavior.  While the topic of consent is relevant to society, it is not directly linked to the electoral process or any specific political entity. The post does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically qualify it as electoral propaganda if the content itself is not promoting or opposing any candidate or party.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Asocia\u021bia Necuvinte</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
