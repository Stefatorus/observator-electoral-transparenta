It does not mention any political candidates, parties, or advocate for or against any political position. The targeting is geographically focused, but this is common for local event promotion and does not inherently constitute electoral propaganda. The content is purely informational and lacks any electoral objective.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 and is not in violation of Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea - Dorohoi</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
