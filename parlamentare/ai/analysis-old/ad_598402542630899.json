The explicit mention of the candidate, the use of campaign hashtags, and the overall tone strongly suggest an attempt to influence voters. While the topic itself (civic education) is not inherently electoral propaganda, the way it's presented in this context makes it highly likely to be considered as such.  The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this interpretation.  The counter-argument could be that the initiative is genuinely beneficial and the candidate is simply promoting it. However, the close association with the election campaign and the use of clear electoral messaging outweighs this possibility.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Pop Sebastian Tiberiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103 de postare], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 598402542630899) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Pop Sebastian Tiberiu pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea PNCR, folosind hashtag-uri electorale \u0219i un cod CMF,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea pozitiv\u0103 a voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
