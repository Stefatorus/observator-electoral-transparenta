It refers to a specific parliamentary candidate (Mohammad Murad), is intended for a wide audience via a paid Facebook post, and has a clear electoral objective: promoting the candidate and his party, AUR.  While presented as an interview, the content lacks the objectivity expected of journalistic reporting and serves primarily as a promotional tool. The timing of the post, even if within the legal timeframe for electoral propaganda, is crucial.  The post's focus on the parliamentary elections and its promotional nature strongly suggest it is electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mohammad Murad</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTomis Tv, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1618099118787045) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Mohammad Murad din partea AUR pentru alegerile parlamentare.
