It refers to a specific candidate (Pop Sebastian Tiberiu), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook campaign, has a clear electoral objective (gaining votes), and does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content, while discussing civic education, is ultimately framed within the context of the candidate's campaign, making it electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Pop Sebastian Tiberiu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103 de postare], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 392299580540497) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Pop Sebastian Tiberiu pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea PNCR, folosind un limbaj persuasiv \u0219i hashtag-uri precum \"#ViitorulEAlT\u0103u\", \"#TineriiVoteaz\u0103\", \"#PutereaVotului\" \u0219i \"#PNCR\", cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
