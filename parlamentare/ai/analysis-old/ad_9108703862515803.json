While the post relates to the parliamentary elections, it does not advocate for or against any specific candidate or party. The objective is to encourage informed voting, not to influence the outcome in favor of a particular candidate. The content is educational and informative, similar to a public service announcement.  There is no direct call to vote for or against anyone.  The post does not violate Article 36 (7) a, b, c, or d because it doesn't directly refer to a candidate, it's not used during a prohibited period, it doesn't have an electoral objective in the sense of promoting a specific candidate, and it remains within the boundaries of journalistic information.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>DifinePR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
