The primary objective of the post appears to be to express opinions on the democratic process and the results of the presidential elections. While the author is a politician, the content itself does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections.

The post presents an opinion piece on the outcome of the presidential elections and the need for better democratic practices. It could be considered a form of citizen journalism, expressing a political opinion. However, the lack of factual reporting and the focus on personal reflection rather than objective analysis weakens this aspect.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>True.
