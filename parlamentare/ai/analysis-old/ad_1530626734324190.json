While the post is from a politician, Mircea Cirt, it doesn't explicitly mention any parliamentary candidate by name or party affiliation. The post focuses on general political themes related to national security and strategic errors, without endorsing or opposing any specific candidate in the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The hashtags (#siguranta, #viitor, #romania) further suggest an attempt to engage a broad segment of the population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>False. The primary objective of the post seems to be to express Mircea Cirt's views on national security and political leadership. While indirectly related to the political landscape, it doesn't explicitly advocate for or against any particular candidate running for parliament. The call for \"leaders free to think about policies for citizens and a secure Romania\" is a general statement, not a direct appeal for votes.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents an opinion piece on a matter of public interest (national security). However, the lack of factual evidence and the use of emotionally charged language (\"errors,\" \"promises empty national security\") blur the line between opinion and propaganda.  It leans more towards opinion than objective journalism.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>True. The post can be interpreted as expressing Mircea Cirt's personal political views and concerns regarding national security.  While it's from a politician, the lack of direct endorsement of a candidate suggests it's more of a personal opinion piece than a piece of electoral propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1530626734324190</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while originating from a politician, does not directly promote or oppose any specific candidate participating in the parliamentary elections.  The content focuses on broader political themes related to national security and leadership, using general statements rather than direct calls for votes. Although the post is from a politician and uses a paid advertisement format, the lack of explicit endorsement or opposition to any parliamentary candidate makes it difficult to classify it as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The post could be considered an expression of personal political opinion, which is not prohibited by the law.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
