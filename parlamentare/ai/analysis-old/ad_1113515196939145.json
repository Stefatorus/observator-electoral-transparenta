The hashtags #briancristian, #briancristian2024, #briancristiandeputat further reinforce this. The mention of  \"Elena Lasconi\" and \"Lasconi pre\u0219edinte\" is problematic, as it could be interpreted as an attempt to leverage another candidate's popularity to boost Brian Cristian's image.  However, the context suggests it's more likely a reference to a political alliance or shared political views rather than a direct endorsement.
