The post refers to Mircea Geoan\u0103, although indirectly, in relation to the Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune.

The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and the content is designed to reach a broad audience, not just specific individuals.  The reach estimate further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While the post doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for a specific candidate, the positive portrayal of Mircea Geoan\u0103's association with Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune could be seen as aiming to improve the party's image and indirectly influence voters' choices. The timing of the post, close to the election, further strengthens this possibility.  However, the article itself is journalistic in nature, reporting on the party's activities. The line between reporting and influencing is blurred here.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post links to an article that appears to be a news piece about Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune. However, the positive framing of Mircea Geoan\u0103's involvement could be considered biased and stray from purely objective journalism.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False.

On one hand, it links to a news article about a political party, which could be considered journalistic. On the other hand, the positive framing of Mircea Geoan\u0103's involvement with the party, coupled with the paid advertisement format and timing close to the election, raises concerns about its potential to influence voters. The lack of explicit calls to vote for a specific candidate makes a definitive conclusion difficult.  However, the potential for indirect influence is significant.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Mircea Geoan\u0103</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Cristian Lungu</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Opinii Independente</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nOpinii Independente, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID 465465409901525) care, de\u0219i prezent\u00e2nd o \u0219tire despre Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune, promoveaz\u0103 indirect imaginea lui Mircea Geoan\u0103 \u0219i Cristian Lungu printr-o prezentare pozitiv\u0103 \u0219i subiectiv\u0103 a implica\u021biei lor \u00een partid, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea indirect\u0103 a votului \u00een favoarea partidului respectiv.
