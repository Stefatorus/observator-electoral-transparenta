The images alone are insufficient to establish an electoral objective or violation of Article 98 t).  While the post is categorized as \"POLITICAL\" and targeted towards a Romanian audience, the lack of comprehensible content prevents a definitive conclusion.  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
