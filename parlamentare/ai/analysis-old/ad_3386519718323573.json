The use of hashtags like #VotulEsteDatoriaNoastr\u0103 and the call to action \"merge\u021bi, oameni buni, la vot!\" clearly addresses the general public.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse Manolache Vasile, the implicit encouragement to vote, coupled with the page's clear association with the candidate, strongly suggests an electoral objective.

The paid advertisement format, targeting a wide audience, and the clear association with the candidate's page strongly suggest an intention to influence the election.  The post's message, while couched in terms of civic duty, functions as a form of electoral propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the overall impact.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 3386519718323573), care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 explicit la votarea lui Manolache Vasile, promoveaz\u0103 participarea la vot \u00eentr-un mod care \u00eel avantajeaz\u0103 indirect.
