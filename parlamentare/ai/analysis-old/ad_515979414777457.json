The post explicitly mentions the \"candidates of the social-democratic team for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies\". While not naming specific candidates, it clearly refers to a specific political party participating in the parliamentary elections (PSD).</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.  The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language used (\"Romania is at a crossroads,\" \"our vote can crucially influence our fate,\" etc.) is clearly aimed at a broad segment of the population, not a specific individual or small group.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to support the PSD candidates. Phrases like \"vote for balance\" and \"those who have proven they know how to govern\" are direct appeals to vote for a specific party. The post aims to influence the outcome of the election by increasing votes for the PSD.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It presents a partisan viewpoint, advocating for a specific political party and its candidates. It does not present balanced information or different perspectives.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post might reflect the author's personal political views, it is presented as a campaign message, not a personal opinion piece. The use of hashtags like #EchipaPSD and #PentruBacau further reinforces its campaign nature.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>515979414777457</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, a paid advertisement by Cristina Breahn\u0103-Prava\u021b, promotes the PSD candidates in the parliamentary elections.  It directly encourages voters to support the PSD, using persuasive language and explicitly mentioning the party.  While it doesn't name individual candidates, the reference to the \"social-democratic team\" is sufficiently specific to constitute electoral propaganda. The post's broad reach via paid advertising on Facebook further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument that it's simply expressing a personal opinion is weak, given the clear campaign-style messaging and the use of hashtags associated with the PSD.  The timing of the post (assuming it was published after the official campaign period ended) is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD Candidates (Unspecified)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nCristina Breahn\u0103-Prava\u021b, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candida\u021bii PSD la alegerile parlamentare, folosind un limbaj persuasiv \u0219i \u00eendemnuri directe la vot pentru echipa social-democrat\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea num\u0103rului de voturi pentru PSD.
