The post explicitly mentions \"Partidul S.O.S. Rom\u00e2nia\" (SOS party) and its position on the ballot (#9) and promotes voting for them in the parliamentary elections. It also mentions Celin Georgescu, but in the context of the presidential elections, which is not the focus of the analysis.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>TRUE. This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The message is not a private communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>TRUE. The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to support the SOS party in the parliamentary elections. The call to action (\"Vot\u0103m Partidul S.O.S.

It refers directly to a specific candidate (SOS party), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the exact end date is not specified, the post's date suggests it might be after the end of the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for SOS), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The fact that it's a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a wide audience reinforces its propagandistic nature.  While it mentions a presidential candidate, the primary focus and call to action are clearly directed towards the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul S.O.S.
