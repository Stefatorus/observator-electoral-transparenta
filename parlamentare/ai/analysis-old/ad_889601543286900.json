It refers to specific candidates (Elena Lasconi, Mihail Neam\u021bu, Samuel Z\u0103rnescu), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters' choices.  The strong negative framing of Lasconi and the positive portrayal of the alternative candidates leave no doubt about its intention to sway public opinion.  While the post does not directly target the parliamentary elections, its influence on the presidential election is undeniable.  The timing of the post is also relevant; if it was posted after the official end of the electoral campaign period, it would be a clear violation of Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Elena Lasconi</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Mihail Neam\u021bu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Samuel Z\u0103rnescu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPeter Costea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 889601543286900) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 negativ\u0103 \u00eempotriva Elenei Lasconi, candidat\u0103 la pre\u0219edin\u021bie, \u0219i propagand\u0103 pozitiv\u0103 pentru Mihail Neam\u021bu \u0219i Samuel Z\u0103rnescu, candida\u021bi la Camera Deputa\u021bilor.
