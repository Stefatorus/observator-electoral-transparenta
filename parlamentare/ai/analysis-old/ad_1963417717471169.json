The paid nature of the advertisement, targeting a wide audience, and the timing (close to election day) strongly suggest an intention to influence voter turnout, indirectly benefiting Manolache Vasile's campaign.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the overall impression of electoral propaganda.  The content fulfills the criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Momentum Motion Pictures SRL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu \u00eel men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit pe Manolache Vasile, \u00eel promoveaz\u0103 indirect prin asocierea cu pagina sa de campanie \u0219i prin \u00eendemnul puternic la participarea la vot, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral pozitiv asupra candidaturii sale.
