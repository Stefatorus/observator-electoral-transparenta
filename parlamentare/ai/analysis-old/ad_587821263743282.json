The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and the content is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, not just a select few. The use of hashtags like #alegeriparlamentare (parliamentary elections) further supports this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While the post presents itself as a news article analyzing candidates' controversial statements, the very act of highlighting these statements in a paid advertisement close to the election could be interpreted as influencing voters' opinions. The title itself is sensationalist and designed to attract attention.  The overall objective seems to be to inform the public about the candidates' behavior, but the method and timing could be seen as an attempt to sway public opinion.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post resembles a news article, presenting information about candidates' controversial statements. However, the context of a paid Facebook advertisement raises questions about its objectivity and journalistic integrity. The sensationalist title and the focus on negative aspects of candidates' behavior suggest a potential bias.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False.

It presents information about candidates' controversial statements, which could be considered newsworthy. However, the fact that this information is presented as a paid advertisement on Facebook, close to the election, raises concerns. The sensationalist title and the focus on negative aspects could be interpreted as an attempt to influence voters' opinions.  While the post doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose any candidate, the method of dissemination and the potential impact on voters' perceptions make it a borderline case.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards considering it electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>info-sud-est.ro</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInfo Sud-Est, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 587821263743282, care, de\u0219i prezent\u00e2nd informa\u021bii despre declara\u021biile controversate ale unor candida\u021bi la alegerile parlamentare, are un titlu senza\u021bionalist \u0219i se concentreaz\u0103 pe aspecte negative, av\u00e2nd poten\u021bialul de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
