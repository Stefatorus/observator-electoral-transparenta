The post refers to Mircea Geoan\u0103, who is associated with the Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune (PRA).

The post highlights the return of Cristian Lungu and the support of Mircea Geoan\u0103 to the PRA.  This is clearly intended to create a positive image and potentially influence voters' perception of the party and its candidates, thus influencing the vote. The positive framing aims to garner support for the party.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False.

While not explicitly calling for votes, the positive framing and association with a candidate clearly aim to influence voters' perceptions and potentially increase support for the PRA. The post's targeting parameters (age, location) further suggest an attempt to reach potential voters.  The post's content and context strongly suggest it's a form of electoral propaganda, even if indirectly.  The timing of the post, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Geoan\u0103</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Opinii Independente</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nOpinii Independente, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite (ID 2511869432349035) care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune (PRA) prin eviden\u021bierea revenirii lui Cristian Lungu \u0219i sprijinul lui Mircea Geoan\u0103, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin crearea unei imagini pozitive \u0219i influen\u021barea percep\u021biei aleg\u0103torilor asupra partidului \u0219i candida\u021bilor s\u0103i.
