The post is a generic International Women's Day greeting, lacking any direct or indirect call to vote for a specific candidate or party. The hashtags used are general and do not promote voting. The content and objective of the post are unrelated to influencing the parliamentary elections.  The timing of the post (before the end of the electoral campaign) is not relevant as the content itself is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
