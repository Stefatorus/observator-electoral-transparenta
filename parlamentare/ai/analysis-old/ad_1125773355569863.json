While the post doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for or against specific candidates, presenting candidates' views on sensitive social issues like women's and LGBTQ+ rights during the election period could indirectly influence voters' choices. The selection of quotes and the parties represented might be interpreted as having an electoral objective, fulfilling Article 36 (7) - c. However, it could also be argued that the objective is to inform the public about the candidates' stances on these issues, which is not inherently illegal.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents itself as a compilation of quotes from various candidates, resembling a form of citizen journalism.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose any candidate, the selection of quotes and the parties represented could be interpreted as having an electoral objective.  The post fulfills criteria a and c of Article 36 (7) and potentially d, making it a borderline case.  The argument against it being electoral propaganda is that it aims to inform the public about candidates' views on important social issues. The argument for it being electoral propaganda is that the selection of quotes and the context could subtly influence voters' choices.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards the latter interpretation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Florina Presad\u0103</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Diana \u0218o\u0219oac\u0103</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Cosette Chichir\u0103u</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Cristian Terhe\u0219</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Szabo Odon</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Alexandra P\u0103curaru</name><impact>NEUTRAL</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>MozaiQ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMozaiQ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1125773355569863) care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 explicit la votul pentru sau \u00eempotriva unor candida\u021bi, prezint\u0103 declara\u021bii selective ale acestora pe teme sensibile (drepturile femeilor \u0219i LGBTQ+), av\u00e2nd poten\u021bialul de a influen\u021ba aleg\u0103torii.
