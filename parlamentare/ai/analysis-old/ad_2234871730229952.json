However, the presence of the CMF number and the clear focus on political issues related to governance and policy strongly suggest an indirect reference to a political party or group.

While not explicitly urging voters to vote for a specific candidate, the detailed policy proposals and the CMF number strongly suggest an intention to influence voters' choices in the upcoming elections.

While it doesn't explicitly name a candidate, the indirect nature of the promotion, coupled with the CMF number, makes it highly likely that this is an attempt to influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections. The post's extensive policy platform is designed to appeal to voters and promote a specific political agenda.  The counter-argument would be that the post focuses on general political issues and doesn't directly advocate for a specific candidate. However, the CMF number and the targeted nature of the advertisement outweigh this argument.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Lorand Toth</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Lorand Toth], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 2234871730229952) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 indirect\u0103, dar evident\u0103, prin prezentarea unui program de guvernare detaliat \u0219i a unui num\u0103r CMF (CMF:11240015),  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea USR,  \u00een ciuda lipsei unei men\u021bion\u0103ri explicite a unui candidat.
