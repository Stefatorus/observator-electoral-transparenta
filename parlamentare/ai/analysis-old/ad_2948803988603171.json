It refers directly to a candidate (Daniela Mihai), is used during the electoral campaign period (judging by the CMF number and the context), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Mihai), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The post's paid nature and targeting within C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i County further solidify its propagandistic intent.  The presence of the CMF number confirms its status as official campaign material.  While the post mentions Mihai's professional background, this is clearly secondary to its primary purpose of promoting her candidacy.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Daniela Mihai</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nROGER GRAPHIC DESIGN SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 2948803988603171) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura Danielei Mihai pentru func\u021bia de senator din partea PSD, folosind imaginea acesteia \u0219i \u00eendemnuri explicite la vot (\"Voteaz\u0103 Calea Sigur\u0103 pentru C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i\").
