The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.

The primary objective of the post is to encourage people to vote, specifically for independent candidates. The call to action (\"Let's go out to vote and change the fate of Romania!\") directly aims to influence electoral behavior. The phrasing \"The war is between PARTIES and PEOPLE\" clearly positions independent candidates as an alternative to established parties, furthering the electoral objective.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents an opinion, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It's a clear advocacy piece promoting a specific viewpoint (voting for independent candidates) rather than providing balanced information.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. Although presented as a personal opinion, the context of a paid Facebook advertisement and the clear call to action to vote for independent candidates transforms it into something beyond a personal expression.

While it doesn't explicitly mention any specific candidate by name, the clear call to action and the framing of the political landscape as a \"war between parties and people\" strongly suggests an intention to influence the vote in favor of independent candidates. The post's broad reach via Facebook advertising and the use of relevant hashtags further supports this conclusion.  The timing of the post, close to election day, also increases the likelihood of influencing voter behavior.  The argument that it's simply a personal opinion is weakened by the fact that it's a paid advertisement, indicating a deliberate attempt to reach a large audience and sway their votes.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Independent Candidates</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVirgil Pirvulescu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul  \u201eR\u0103zboiul este \u00eentre PARTIDE \u0219i OAMENI.
