The post lacks any direct or indirect endorsement of a specific candidate or party participating in the parliamentary elections. It focuses on a general societal issue, presented in an informative and opinionated style consistent with journalistic or citizen journalism.  The absence of a CMF number further supports this conclusion.  The post's objective appears to be raising awareness about the importance of long-term energy investments, not influencing voters' choices in the election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Eoficial.ro</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
