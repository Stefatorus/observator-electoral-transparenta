While the post features the mayor's image, it does not promote him in the context of a parliamentary election. The content is celebratory and does not advocate for or against any candidate. The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically make it electoral propaganda. The post's objective is to communicate a festive message, not to influence voters in an election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Moldova Invest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
