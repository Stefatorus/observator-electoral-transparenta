While the post is clearly related to the Romanian parliamentary elections and targets the Hungarian minority, it does not explicitly mention any specific candidate by name or surname.  The post promotes voting for the RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania) party, but doesn't single out individual candidates.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience, specifically the Hungarian-speaking population of Romania. The targeting parameters further support this.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage members of the Hungarian minority in Romania to vote for the RMDSZ in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The phrasing (\"December 1-j\u00e9n a magyarok nem vesz\u00edthetnek,\" which translates to \"On December 1st, Hungarians cannot lose\") directly urges participation in the election with the implied goal of supporting the RMDSZ.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. It presents a partisan viewpoint, urging voters to support a specific political party, and uses emotionally charged language (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\" - \"We are in danger!\") to sway public opinion.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it promotes a political agenda and encourages voters to act in a specific way (vote for RMDSZ).</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1090345325891072</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by RMDSZ, constitutes electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't name specific candidates, it directly promotes the RMDSZ party in the context of the parliamentary elections. The language used is clearly designed to influence voters, urging them to participate and implicitly support the RMDSZ. The targeting of the Hungarian minority within Romania further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's design and messaging are not consistent with neutral information dissemination; rather, they aim to persuade voters to support a particular party.  The post's timing, close to the election, also contributes to its classification as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1090345325891072) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea partidului RMDSZ.
