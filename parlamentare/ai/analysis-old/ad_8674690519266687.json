While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to a specific candidate's official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post quotes Bishop L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6cskei of Nagyv\u00e1rad, urging the Hungarian community to vote. While it doesn't explicitly name a candidate, it strongly implies support for candidates representing the interests of the Hungarian community in Romania.  This indirectly refers to candidates from UDMR (Uniunea Democrat\u0103 Maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia), given the context and the advertiser's identity (\"RMDSZ Bihar Megye,\" the Hungarian name for UDMR Bihor County).  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a could potentially apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.  The message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience within the Hungarian community in Bihor County, Romania.  Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to encourage voting within the Hungarian community.  The message implies that not voting would be detrimental to their interests.

Given the advertiser is RMDSZ Bihar Megye (UDMR Bihor County), this implicitly promotes UDMR candidates. The paid Facebook advertisement targets a wide audience and aims to influence voter turnout, fulfilling the criteria for electoral propaganda under Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The timing of the post, after the official campaign period, is a crucial factor.  While the post itself might not directly violate Article 98 t) if the campaign period was still ongoing, the context and the implicit endorsement of UDMR candidates raise serious concerns.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>UDMR Candidates (Bihor County)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Bihar Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin promovarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unui mesaj care \u00eendeamn\u0103 comunitatea maghiar\u0103 din jude\u021bul Bihor la vot, f\u0103r\u0103 a men\u021biona candida\u021bi specifici, dar implicit sus\u021bin\u00e2nd candida\u021bii UDMR, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de cre\u0219tere a particip\u0103rii la vot \u00een r\u00e2ndul unui electorat favorabil UDMR.
