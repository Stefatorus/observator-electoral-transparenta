The post does not mention any parliamentary candidates or parties, nor does it advocate for or against any candidate. The content is purely celebratory and community-oriented.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform does not automatically make it electoral propaganda.  The targeting parameters (age, location) are consistent with a community event announcement. There is no evidence suggesting an intention to influence the vote in the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
