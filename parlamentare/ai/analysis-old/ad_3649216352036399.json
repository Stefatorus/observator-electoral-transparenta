While it's a paid Facebook post targeting a wide audience, the lack of discernible text makes it impossible to assess whether it refers to a candidate, has an electoral objective, or falls under any other criteria of Article 36 (7).  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being electoral propaganda.  In dubio pro reo, the benefit of the doubt should be given.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Costel Fotea</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
