While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be officially sanctioned campaign material.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post uses the phrase \"Ha Magyari Albert 96 \u00e9vesen is elmegy szavazni, akkor vas\u00e1rnap neked is a szavaz\u00f3f\u00fclk\u00e9ben a helyed!\" which translates to \"If Magyari Albert goes to vote at 96 years old, then Sunday is your place in the polling booth!\". While it doesn't explicitly name a candidate, it strongly encourages voting, implicitly suggesting support for a particular candidate or party.  This is a subtle but potentially influential message.  The context of the post, linked to Kovacs Mihaly Levente's Facebook page, further strengthens this interpretation.  Article 36 (7) - a might apply depending on whether Magyari Albert is associated with a specific candidate or party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.

While not explicitly endorsing a specific candidate, the implicit message strongly suggests support for a particular political viewpoint or party. The use of a prominent figure, Magyari Albert, as an example further amplifies this effect.  The timing of the post, close to election day, further strengthens the argument that its objective is to influence the vote.

The context of the post, being a paid advertisement on Facebook by Kovacs Mihaly Levente, and its timing close to election day, strongly suggests an intention to influence the vote.  The implicit endorsement, combined with the broad reach of the Facebook ad, makes it highly likely to be considered electoral propaganda.  The lack of a CMF number weakens the case slightly, but the other factors outweigh this.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Magyari Albert</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nKovacs Mih\u00e1ly Levente, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"Ha Magyari Albert 96 \u00e9vesen is elmegy szavazni, akkor vas\u00e1rnap neked is a szavaz\u00f3f\u00fclk\u00e9ben a helyed!\", care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, are un efect electoral clar de \u00eencurajare a votului, implicit suger\u00e2nd sus\u021binerea unui anumit candidat sau partid, av\u00e2nd \u00een vedere contextul \u0219i momentul public\u0103rii.
