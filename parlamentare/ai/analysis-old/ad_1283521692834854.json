Given the targeting, hashtags, and the clear intent to influence voters' choices, it is highly likely that this constitutes electoral propaganda. The post's questions are designed to generate positive sentiment and implicitly encourage support for the team.  The paid nature of the Facebook post further strengthens this conclusion.  However, a definitive determination requires confirmation that Valeriu Iftime is a registered candidate for the parliamentary elections. If he is not, the post might still be considered political advertising, but not necessarily electoral propaganda in the context of the specific election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Valeriu Iftime (Team)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Dorohoi</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Dorohoi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1283521692834854, care promoveaz\u0103 indirect echipa lui Valeriu Iftime,  prin \u00eentreb\u0103ri sugestive menite s\u0103 genereze un sentiment pozitiv \u0219i s\u0103 influen\u021beze votul aleg\u0103torilor \u00een favoarea acestora, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral o cre\u0219tere a popularit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i a voturilor pentru echipa respectiv\u0103.  \u00centreb\u0103rile \u201eCe mesaj transmit boto\u0219\u00e2nenii #echipei Valeriu Iftime pentru Parlament?
