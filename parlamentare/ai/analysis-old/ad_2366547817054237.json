While the topic is political, the post itself does not advocate for or against any specific candidate or party participating in the parliamentary elections. The objective seems to be data collection for research, not influencing the electoral outcome.  The post does not violate Article 36 (7) a, b, c, or d because it does not directly refer to a candidate, it is not used during the electoral campaign (although the timing is close to the election), it does not have a clear electoral objective, and it does not exceed the limits of journalistic activity (assuming the survey is conducted and results are published transparently).  The fact that it's a paid post doesn't automatically make it electoral propaganda; the content itself is key.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
