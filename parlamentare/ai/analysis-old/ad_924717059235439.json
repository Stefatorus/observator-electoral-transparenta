The post refers to Ioan Balan, a PNL deputy. While it doesn't explicitly advocate for voting for him, it highlights a project he claims as a PNL achievement.

While not explicitly calling for votes, the post attributes a positive achievement (highway project) to the PNL, potentially influencing voters' perception of the party.

It highlights a positive achievement attributed to the party, potentially influencing voters' perceptions. The targeting of the ad to a specific region and demographic groups further strengthens the argument that this is a form of electoral propaganda.  While it doesn't directly violate Article 36 (7) - a by explicitly mentioning voting, it arguably violates Article 36 (7) - c by having an electoral objective (indirectly promoting PNL) and addressing the wide population. The lack of a balanced journalistic approach also weakens the argument that it falls under journalistic reporting.  The timing of the ad, even if within the legal timeframe, is relevant to its potential impact.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Ioan Balan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Informatia ta</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Informatia ta], pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook, cu ID-ul 924717059235439, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu solicit\u0103 explicit votul pentru un candidat, prezint\u0103 informa\u021bii \u00eentr-un mod care favorizeaz\u0103 puternic PNL, atribuindu-i realizarea unui proiect de infrastructur\u0103 (autostrada Pa\u0219cani-Suceava).
