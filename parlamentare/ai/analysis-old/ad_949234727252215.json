This is done without explicitly naming a party, but the context clearly indicates an electoral objective. The targeting data shows a wide geographical reach, indicating an attempt to influence a large number of voters.  While no CMF number is present, the clear endorsement of a political entity or candidate during the electoral period makes it highly likely to be considered electoral propaganda.  The post lacks journalistic objectivity, instead focusing on persuasive language to sway voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime (or associated political entity)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Dorohoi</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Dorohoi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 949234727252215) care promoveaz\u0103, \u00eentr-un mod evident pozitiv \u0219i persuasiv, echipa lui Valeriu Iftime, prezent\u00e2ndu-i ca o \u201esolu\u021bie s\u0103n\u0103toas\u0103\u201d pentru viitorul jude\u021bului, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestuia sau a entit\u0103\u021bii politice asociate, f\u0103r\u0103 a respecta prevederile legale privind \u00eencheierea campaniei electorale.
