It meets all the criteria outlined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  It directly refers to a specific candidate (Petru Farago), is used during the electoral campaign period (as evidenced by the CMF number), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Farago), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement.  There are no journalistic elements present; it's purely promotional. The presence of the CMF number further solidifies its nature as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>PETRU FARAGO</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSC KLING CONSULTING SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1631706347773457) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui PETRU FARAGO pentru UDMR la Camera Deputa\u021bilor, pozi\u021bia 1 pe buletinul de vot, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestuia.
