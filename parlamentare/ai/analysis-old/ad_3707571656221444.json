While the post mentions the RMDSZ (Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania), it does not refer to a specific candidate by name or surname.  The post focuses on the success of the Transylvanian Hungarians in the elections, not on a specific individual.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is published on a public Facebook page (\"Maszol.ro\") and is a paid advertisement, indicating an intention to reach a wide audience. The language used is general, addressing \"Transylvanian Hungarians\" as a collective.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Partially True. The post celebrates the electoral success of Transylvanian Hungarians, which could be interpreted as indirectly promoting the RMDSZ. However, it doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote for any specific candidate. The primary objective seems to be reporting on and celebrating the outcome, rather than directly influencing the vote.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>True. The post reads more like a news report or opinion piece celebrating a political outcome. It presents an interpretation of the election results and their significance, which is consistent with journalistic practices.  The language used is not overtly persuasive or promotional.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses a positive opinion about the election results, it's presented within a journalistic framework, not as a personal opinion unrelated to the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>3707571656221444</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post celebrates the electoral success of Transylvanian Hungarians, which could be seen as indirectly promoting the RMDSZ. However, it lacks explicit calls to vote for specific candidates and is presented in a style consistent with journalistic reporting.  The line between reporting on an event and promoting a party is blurred here, but given the lack of direct calls to action and the journalistic framing, it leans towards not being electoral propaganda.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle further supports this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Maszol.ro</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
