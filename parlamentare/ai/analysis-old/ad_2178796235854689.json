The post refers to Ciprian Ivanov, the mayor of Cop\u0103l\u0103u commune. While not explicitly a parliamentary candidate, the post highlights his achievements in local governance, which could indirectly influence voters' perception of his political affiliation and capabilities.  This indirectly relates to \"Article 36 (7) - a\" as it refers to a political figure.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and uses hashtags (#voceabotosani #botosani #comuna_Cop\u0103l\u0103u) suggesting an intention to reach a wide audience beyond personal communication. This fulfills \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. While not directly advocating for a vote for a specific parliamentary candidate, the post's positive portrayal of Ciprian Ivanov's performance as mayor could indirectly influence voters' opinions in the upcoming parliamentary elections.  The positive framing of his work could be interpreted as subtly promoting his political alignment and implicitly encouraging support for his party or similar ideologies in the parliamentary elections. This is a subjective interpretation, but given the context of a paid political advertisement, it leans towards fulfilling \"Article 36 (7) - c\".</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents information about local governance, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. The overwhelmingly positive tone and focus on the mayor's achievements suggest a promotional rather than informative intent.

The post is not expressing a personal opinion; it's a promotional piece designed to present a positive image of a political figure.

This positive portrayal, within the context of a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a wide audience in Boto\u0219ani County, could be interpreted as a form of indirect electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post, close to the parliamentary elections, further strengthens this interpretation.  The argument against it being propaganda is that it focuses on local governance and doesn't directly mention parliamentary elections or candidates. However, the positive image created could subtly influence voters' perceptions and preferences in the parliamentary elections.  The lack of a CMF number is not conclusive evidence against it being propaganda, as it could be a local politician not directly involved in the parliamentary race.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Botosani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 2178796235854689) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care prezint\u0103 o imagine extrem de favorabil\u0103 a lui Ciprian Ivanov, primarul comunei Cop\u0103l\u0103u, f\u0103r\u0103 a men\u021biona direct alegerile parlamentare, dar av\u00e2nd un efect electoral indirect prin influen\u021barea percep\u021biei publice asupra sa \u0219i, implicit, asupra partidului s\u0103u sau a unor ideologii similare.
