It directly mentions the party, expresses support for it, and implicitly links it to a positive future.  The post's design and placement as a paid advertisement on a public platform clearly target a wide audience. While it begins with a seemingly neutral call for respect, the subsequent endorsement of the PNL outweighs this, making the overall message a clear attempt to influence voters.  The absence of a CMF number is noteworthy but doesn't negate the promotional nature of the post.  The post fulfills all criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, defining it as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRafael Nichita, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 581415000943629) care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru PNL, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestui partid.
