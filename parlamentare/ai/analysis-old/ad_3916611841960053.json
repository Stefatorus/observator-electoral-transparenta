The post is a news article shared on a public Facebook page with a paid promotion, aiming to reach a wide audience.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective seems to be informing the public about protests against C\\u0103lin Georgescu. While it could indirectly influence voters' opinions, the main focus is reporting on the events, not explicitly advocating for or against a candidate.  The slogans used in the protests (\"Nu vota\u021bi un dictator\", \"O \u021bar\u0103 ca afar\u0103 nu e legionar\u0103\") are clearly negative towards Georgescu, but the post itself is reporting on the event, not directly promoting the message.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post appears to be journalistic in nature, reporting on public protests.

While the protests themselves contain slogans that could be considered electoral propaganda, the post's primary function is journalistic reporting.  The slogans are presented as part of the news, not as an endorsement.  The post does not directly advocate for or against any candidate.  The fact that it is a paid post does not automatically make it electoral propaganda if the content itself is primarily journalistic.  The timing of the post (after the first round of presidential elections) is relevant, but the post does not explicitly encourage or discourage voting for any candidate in the context of the ongoing election.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>C\\u0103lin Georgescu</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Mediashare</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
