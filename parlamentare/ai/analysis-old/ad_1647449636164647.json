The hashtag is a general call to vote, not a specific call to vote for a particular candidate.  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the argument for it being electoral propaganda. While the post is paid for and has a wide reach, its content is too generic to be considered electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  The \"choose your voice\" message is a general encouragement to vote, not an attempt to sway votes towards a specific candidate.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
