The post explicitly mentions the author's intention to run for a public office (\"viitor deputat\"). While not naming a specific candidate from the provided list, the author's self-identification as a candidate fulfills this criterion.  This aligns with Article 36 (7) - a, as it directly refers to a person running for election.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language used (\"Dragi prieteni,\" \"noi to\u021bi,\" \"viitorul Rom\u00e2niei\") further supports this conclusion. This satisfies Article 36 (7) - c.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Potentially True. The post proposes a legislative initiative aimed at improving the quality of public leadership and increasing public trust in politics. While not explicitly urging voters to vote for the author, the underlying objective is to present the author as a competent and responsible candidate who is concerned with improving the political system. This could be interpreted as indirectly influencing voters' choices.  This is a crucial point for determining if Article 36 (7) - c applies.  The post aims to improve public perception of the author, which could translate into more votes.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents a policy proposal, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content. The language is persuasive and promotional, aiming to garner support for the author's initiative and, by extension, the author himself. It does not present a balanced view or counterarguments.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post is not simply expressing a personal opinion; it's actively promoting a specific policy proposal as part of the author's political platform. The call to action (\"Voi ce p\u0103rere ave\u021bi despre aceast\u0103 ini\u021biativ\u0103? A\u021bi sus\u021bine-o?\") further reinforces the promotional intent.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>946373124019157</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly endorsing a vote for a specific candidate, promotes the author's candidacy by presenting a policy proposal as part of their platform. The paid advertisement format and persuasive language suggest an intention to influence voters' perceptions and potentially increase support for the author.  The lack of objectivity and the call to action further strengthen this interpretation.  However, the post does not directly instruct voters to vote for or against any specific candidate at a polling station.  The ambiguity lies in whether the indirect promotion of the author's candidacy constitutes electoral propaganda under the given legal framework.  In dubio pro reo, we must consider the potential for electoral influence.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Sebastian - Tiberiu Pop</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPop Sebastian Tiberiu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 946373124019157), care, de\u0219i nu \u00eendeamn\u0103 direct la votul pentru un anumit candidat, promoveaz\u0103 indirect candidatura sa prin prezentarea unei propuneri legislative ca parte a platformei sale politice.
