While the post presents itself as investigative journalism, the focus on a specific PNL candidate and the use of potentially inflammatory language (\"Camorra,\" \"criminal group\") could be interpreted as an attempt to negatively influence public opinion towards Adrian Cozma and, by extension, the PNL.  The headline itself is designed to attract attention and potentially sway voters.  Further investigation into the linked article's content is needed to definitively assess the objective.

The post presents itself as an investigative journalistic piece, reporting on alleged criminal activity surrounding a political figure.

The explicit mention of Adrian Cozma, the use of inflammatory language, and the potential for swaying public opinion against him and the PNL raise concerns. The sensationalized headline and lack of clear evidence within the post itself further suggest an intention to influence the election, rather than simply report facts.  However, without reviewing the linked article's content, a definitive conclusion cannot be reached. The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied, but the evidence leans towards a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Adrian Cozma</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Gazeta de Nord-Vest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nGazeta de Nord-Vest, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 3870108766578700) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu con\u021binut ce vizeaz\u0103 negativ pe Adrian Cozma, pre\u0219edintele PNL Satu Mare, folosind un limbaj inflamator (\"Camorra,\" \"grup infrac\u021bional organizat\") f\u0103r\u0103 a prezenta dovezi concrete \u00een postare, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a opiniei publice asupra candidatului \u0219i partidului s\u0103u.
