It refers to a specific candidate (Florin Barbur), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to choose position 10 (REPER) on the ballot. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The post's content is promotional, not journalistic.  There are no counterarguments to suggest otherwise.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>FLORIN BARBUR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAtelierul de internet SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 927513996021099) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui FLORIN BARBUR pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea partidului REPER, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd aleg\u0103torii s\u0103 voteze pozi\u021bia 10 pe buletinul de vot.
