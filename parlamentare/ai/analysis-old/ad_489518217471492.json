The post explicitly mentions the PSD (Partidul Social Democrat) and encourages voting for them, referencing their position on the ballot (position 2).

The primary objective of the post is to persuade voters to choose the PSD in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

The post directly targets the parliamentary elections, urging voters to support the PSD. The use of persuasive language, visual aids (the image), and the paid advertisement format all contribute to its classification as electoral propaganda.  The post's objective is clearly to influence voters' choices in the election.  While the post mentions broader political themes (stability, development), these are used instrumentally to promote the PSD.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAdrian T\u0103rc\u0103, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 489518217471492) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru PSD, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru acest partid \u0219i prezent\u00e2nd argumente persuasive \u00een favoarea acestuia, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba rezultatul alegerilor parlamentare.
