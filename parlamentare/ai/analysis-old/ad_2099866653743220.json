The use of hashtags further suggests an attempt to broaden its reach beyond a personal communication.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post promotes a vision for education reform (\"Vrem un stat \u00een care \u0219coala \u00eenseamn\u0103 educa\u021bie real\u0103 \u0219i aplicat\u0103, un loc f\u0103r\u0103 pariuri, droguri \u0219i bullying\"). While this is a policy position that could influence voters' choices, the connection to a specific candidate or party's electoral platform is indirect. The primary objective seems to be promoting the party's general stance on education, rather than directly urging voters to support a particular candidate.  The hashtag #alegevocearauniunii further reinforces the party's identity, but doesn't explicitly call for a vote for a specific candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be interpreted as a form of political communication, expressing the party's views on a societal issue.

The content focuses on a policy position (education reform) rather than directly influencing the vote.  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being direct electoral propaganda. While the post is clearly political in nature and aims to promote the UDMR's image, it doesn't meet all the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The argument against it being electoral propaganda is stronger than the argument for it.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
