It targets a specific demographic (Hungarian speakers in Romania) with a clear message urging them to vote to prevent a perceived threat to their interests. The post's timing, close to election day, and its direct call to action strongly suggest an intention to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections. While no specific candidate is named, the implicit endorsement of candidates representing Hungarian interests makes it a form of electoral propaganda. The paid nature of the post on a public platform further strengthens this conclusion.  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to negate the evidence of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>UDMR candidates</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Bihar Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri (ID 1133970618342201) cu con\u021binut electoral, care \u00eendeamn\u0103 popula\u021bia maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia s\u0103 voteze pentru a preveni o presupus\u0103 amenin\u021bare la adresa intereselor lor, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin \u00eendemnul direct la vot (\"Pe 1 decembrie, maghiarii nu pot pierde\").
