The primary objective of the post is to influence voters' choices in the parliamentary elections.

It directly refers to specific parliamentary candidates (USR, PNL, and implicitly PSD), targets a wide audience through a paid advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters' choices. The statement is presented as a fact, not an opinion, and lacks journalistic neutrality. The post's timing, after the official campaign period, further strengthens the case for a violation.  While the post doesn't explicitly advocate for or against a specific candidate, its implication is to negatively influence voters' perception of USR and PNL, potentially benefiting another party.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nClaudiu-Iorga Palaz, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame platite cu mesajul \"Votezi USR sau votezi PNL = Votezi PSD!\",  care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei electorale.
