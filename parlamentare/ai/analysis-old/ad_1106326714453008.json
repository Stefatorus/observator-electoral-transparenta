It targets a specific candidate, uses targeted advertising to reach a wide audience in Boto\u0219ani County, and aims to influence voters' opinions by posing a leading question about their support for the candidate.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but the clear electoral objective outweighs this. The post's design and phrasing are suggestive of an attempt to sway public opinion in favor of Valeriu Iftime.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Valeriu Iftime</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nVocea Boto\u0219ani, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1106326714453008) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu face o sus\u021binere explicit\u0103, promoveaz\u0103 indirect candidatul Valeriu Iftime printr-o \u00eentrebare sugestiv\u0103 adresat\u0103 publicului larg din jude\u021bul Boto\u0219ani, viz\u00e2nd influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestuia.
