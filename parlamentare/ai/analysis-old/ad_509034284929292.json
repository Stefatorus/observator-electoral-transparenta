The post highlights Serban's political achievements and influence within the PSD, presenting him in a positive light.  This is done through a structured narrative, not a personal opinion. The post's objective is clearly to influence voters' perception of Serban and encourage them to vote for him.  The targeting of Neam\u021b County, where Serban is running, further strengthens this conclusion.  While the post doesn't explicitly call for votes, its content is undeniably electoral propaganda.  The lack of journalistic objectivity and the clear intention to influence voters make it a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>CIPRIAN CONSTANTIN SERBAN</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMoldova Invest, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 509034284929292) care promoveaz\u0103 pe Ciprian Constantin Serban, candidat PSD la Camera Deputa\u021bilor, prezent\u00e2ndu-l \u00eentr-o lumin\u0103 pozitiv\u0103 \u0219i eviden\u021biind influen\u021ba sa politic\u0103, f\u0103r\u0103 a respecta standardele jurnalismului obiectiv.
