While not explicitly naming Brian Cristian, the post refers to \"Un ales\" (an elected official) and highlights his actions in Parliament, strongly implying Brian Cristian, given the context of the advertiser (USR Maramures) and the page name (\"Brian Cristian\").  The post uses \"am f\u0103cut lumin\u0103 acolo unde al\u021bii au t\u0103cut\" (I shed light where others were silent), which is a clear attempt to portray him in a positive light.

The primary objective is to positively influence voters' perception of Brian Cristian and encourage them to vote for him.

The post uses language designed to positively influence voters' perception of him and encourages them to vote for him. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens the indication of electoral propaganda. While the post doesn't explicitly mention the parliamentary elections, the context (advertiser, page name, content) makes it clear that the intended effect is to influence the outcome of the elections.  The post's content is promotional, lacking the objectivity of journalistic reporting.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 890958233105596) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Brian Cristian, utiliz\u00e2nd fraze precum \"Alege\u021bi oameni care muncesc pentru voi\" \u0219i \"s\u0103 avem o Rom\u00e2nia pentru to\u021bi, nu doar pentru unii!\", cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul \u00een favoarea acestuia.
