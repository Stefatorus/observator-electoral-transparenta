While the absence of a CMF number is not automatically disqualifying, it suggests the post may not be officially sanctioned electoral propaganda.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions several political parties (PNL, PSD, PNCR) but doesn't explicitly endorse or attack any specific candidate.  It focuses on general political themes and criticisms of current politics. While it uses hashtags like #PopSebastianTiberiu, this is more likely self-promotion than direct campaigning for a specific election.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The hashtags and general nature of the message further support this conclusion.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective appears to be to express the author's political views and promote his personal brand. While implicitly critical of existing politics, it doesn't directly advocate for voting for or against any particular candidate in the parliamentary elections. The call to action (\"Give a share if YOU also believe that Romania needs a different kind of politics!\") is general and doesn't explicitly endorse a specific candidate or party.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be considered a form of citizen journalism, expressing a personal opinion on political issues. However, the promotional nature and use of hashtags blur the lines.  The lack of factual claims and reliance on emotional appeals weakens its journalistic credibility.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post primarily expresses a personal opinion about the state of Romanian politics. While it uses strong language (\"Politics does NOT mean to lie. Politics does NOT mean to disappoint.\"), it doesn't directly instruct voters on who to support or oppose.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>453236837821057</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post walks a fine line.  While it discusses political issues and uses hashtags associated with a political candidate (Pop Sebastian Tiberiu), it lacks the explicit endorsement or call to action typically associated with electoral propaganda. The general criticism of current politics and the call for a \"different kind of politics\" are not specific enough to constitute a violation. The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being electoral propaganda.  However, the paid nature of the post and the use of the candidate's name in hashtags could be interpreted as an attempt to indirectly influence voters.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards a non-violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Pop Sebastian Tiberiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
