The phrase \"profesorul de \u0219mecheri\" appears to be a nickname or informal reference, not a clear identification of a candidate as required by Article 36 (7) - a.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.  This indicates an intention to reach a wide audience, not just a specific individual or small group. Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's content focuses on the alleged wealth accumulation of an individual referred to as \"profesorul de \u0219mecheri.\" While this could indirectly relate to a political figure, the primary objective doesn't seem to be directly influencing votes for or against any specific candidate in the parliamentary elections.  The connection to the elections is tenuous at best.  There's no explicit call to vote for or against anyone.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post is published by \"ReporterSM,\" which suggests a journalistic approach. The content hints at an investigative piece focusing on a public figure's wealth. However, without more context about the \"profesorul de \u0219mecheri,\" it's difficult to definitively classify it as purely journalistic. The lack of clear evidence of bias or an overt attempt to sway voters leans towards a journalistic interpretation, but this is not conclusive.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post doesn't express a personal opinion; rather, it presents an allegation requiring further investigation.  It's presented as a news item, not a personal viewpoint.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1651662935765985</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while published by a media outlet and on a public platform, lacks direct reference to any parliamentary candidate. The subject matter, focusing on the wealth of an unnamed individual, is indirectly political but doesn't explicitly aim to influence the parliamentary elections.  The connection is too weak to definitively classify it as electoral propaganda.  While the timing is close to the election, this alone is insufficient.  The absence of a CMF number further weakens the case for it being electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>ReporterSM</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
