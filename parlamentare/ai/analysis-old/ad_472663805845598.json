It directly refers to a candidate (Dan Cosma), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the exact end date is not specified, the post's date suggests it's within the campaign period), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for AUR), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's language is explicitly designed to mobilize voters for AUR.  There are no counterarguments to suggest otherwise.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>DAN COSMA</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Dan Cosma], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri (ID 472663805845598) cu con\u021binut electoral, care \u00eendepline\u0219te toate criteriile propagandei electorale conform articolului 36 (7) din LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, av\u00e2nd ca scop influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea candidatului Dan Cosma \u0219i a partidului AUR, prin fraze precum \u201eNu pot ei fura c\u00e2t putem noi vota!\u201d, \u201eLa parlamentare, vota\u021bi AUR\u201d, \u0219i prezentarea vizibil\u0103 a logo-ului AUR \u0219i a candidaturii lui Dan Cosma.
