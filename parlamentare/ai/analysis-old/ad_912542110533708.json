While the post presents itself as a news article, the focus on Dumitri\u021ba Gliga and her family's alleged connections to the PSD party could be interpreted as an attempt to influence voters' perceptions of the PSD and, by extension, Dumitri\u021ba Gliga. The negative portrayal of the family and their alleged actions could sway public opinion against the PSD.  The objective is not explicitly stated, but the content strongly suggests an attempt to influence voters' opinions, fulfilling Article 36 (7) - c.  Further investigation into the overall reporting of the news outlet would be needed to determine if this is a pattern of biased reporting or a single instance.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially True. The post is presented as a news article from \"Ziarul Tricolorul,\" a news website. However, the highly critical and potentially biased tone raises questions about its objectivity.  The lack of counterpoints or alternative perspectives weakens its journalistic integrity.  The headline and the excerpt suggest a narrative that could be considered biased and intended to influence public opinion rather than simply reporting facts.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it presents information in a manner that suggests a pre-determined narrative, aiming to influence public opinion.

It directly refers to a parliamentary candidate (Dumitri\u021ba Gliga) and her party (PSD), using potentially biased language to portray them negatively. The post's wide reach through paid advertising on Facebook suggests an intention to influence voters' opinions. While the post could be argued as journalism, the lack of objectivity and the potential for influencing the election outcome lean towards classifying it as electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Dumitri\u021ba Gliga</name>\n    <impact>NEGATIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Ziarul Tricolorul</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nZiarul Tricolorul, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unui articol (ID postare Facebook: 912542110533708) cu con\u021binut tenden\u021bios \u0219i negativ despre Dumitri\u021ba Gliga, deputat \u0219i membru PSD,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a opiniei publice fa\u021b\u0103 de aceasta \u0219i, implicit, fa\u021b\u0103 de PSD.
