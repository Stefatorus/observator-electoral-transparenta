It refers to a specific political party (REPER) participating in the elections, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support REPER. The timing of the post, close to election day, further strengthens the case.  The lack of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to overturn the conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>REPER</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[REPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul \"D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba voteaz\u0103 REPER pe 1 decembrie!\", care \u00eendeamn\u0103 direct la vot pentru Partidul REPER, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a votului \u00een favoarea acestuia, fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale de campanie.
