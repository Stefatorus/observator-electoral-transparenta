While not explicitly urging voters to vote for a specific candidate, the post's clear association with the PSD and its focus on a policy designed to attract voters strongly suggests an electoral objective. The targeting of the ad to a specific region and demographic further reinforces this.  The post's timing, within the electoral period, also contributes to its classification as electoral propaganda.  The lack of counterarguments or alternative perspectives, coupled with the positive framing of the PSD's proposal, leans away from journalistic objectivity.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul Social Democrat (PSD)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMedia Smart SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1775434133288283) care promoveaz\u0103 o m\u0103sur\u0103 a Partidului Social Democrat (PSD) referitoare la neimpozitarea pensiilor, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor din jude\u021bul Alba \u00een favoarea PSD.
