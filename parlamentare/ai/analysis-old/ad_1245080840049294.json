The presence of a CMF number, the implicit criticism of a candidate or party using AI-generated illusions, the clear call to not vote for a certain entity, and the paid advertisement format all point towards a violation.  While it doesn't explicitly name a candidate, the indirect reference and the clear intent to influence voting behavior are sufficient to classify it as electoral propaganda. The post's emotional appeal and lack of objectivity further solidify this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Unspecified</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAlexandru Rogobete, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1245080840049294, care con\u021bine un mesaj subiectiv \u0219i manipulativ, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la nevotarea unei entit\u0103\u021bi nedefinite, dar implicit sugerat\u0103 ca fiind responsabil\u0103 de utilizarea inteligen\u021bei artificiale pentru propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103,  prin fraze precum \u201eNU VOTA\u021aI O ILUZIE CREAT\u0102 DE INTELIGEN\u021a\u0102 ARTIFICIAL\u0102!\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a votului, \u00eencalc\u00e2nd astfel prevederile legale privind interzicerea propagandei electorale dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale.
