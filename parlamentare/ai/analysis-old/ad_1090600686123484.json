The hashtags and slogans are clearly designed to influence voters to support the UDMR. While it doesn't explicitly name candidates, the context strongly implies an electoral objective. The post's reach is broad due to its paid nature on a public platform.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the clear intent of electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post (end date is after the election) is crucial.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Demeter Andr\u00e1s Istv\u00e1n</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ/UDMR, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu hashtag-uri precum #echipapentruilfovsenat \u0219i #UDMR, care promoveaz\u0103 direct candidatul Demeter Andr\u00e1s Istv\u00e1n \u0219i partidul UDMR pentru alegerile parlamentare, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestora, fapt demonstrat de con\u021binutul reclamei \u0219i de utilizarea unor slogane precum \u201eAlege Vocea Ra\u021biunii\u201d,  \u0219i ID-ul post\u0103rii pe Facebook fiind 1090600686123484.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
