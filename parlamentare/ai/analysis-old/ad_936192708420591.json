It mentions candidates in general terms, asking about the public's perception of them.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The questions posed are directed at the general public in Boto\u0219ani.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The objective is debatable. While the post discusses parliamentary candidates and their image among voters, it doesn't explicitly encourage voting for or against any specific candidate.  It focuses on gauging public opinion, which could be considered journalistic in nature. However, the timing close to the election could be interpreted as an attempt to indirectly influence voters by highlighting certain candidates' popularity.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post could be interpreted as a form of citizen journalism, aiming to report on public opinion regarding candidates. The questions are open-ended and don't promote a particular viewpoint. However, the lack of in-depth analysis or factual reporting weakens this argument.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Not applicable.

While it doesn't explicitly endorse or oppose any candidate, its focus on public perception of candidates in the days leading up to the election could be construed as an attempt to indirectly influence voting behavior. The lack of a clear call to action and the open-ended nature of the questions mitigate this, but the proximity to the election and the paid advertisement format raise concerns.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea - Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
