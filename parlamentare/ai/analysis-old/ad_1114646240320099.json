It refers to a specific candidate (George Grasu), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual election date to confirm if it's after the legal deadline), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Grasu and SOS Romania), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The only potential mitigating factor is the end date of the advertisement, which needs verification against the actual election date to determine if it violates the post-election propaganda ban. However, given the other strong indicators, the likelihood of it being electoral propaganda is high.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>George Grasu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>SOS</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSC Columna Film Studio SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1114646240320099) care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul George Grasu pentru Camera Deputa\u021bilor din partea Partidului SOS Rom\u00e2nia, Filiala D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, inclusiv men\u021bionarea pozi\u021biei sale pe buletinul de vot (pozi\u021bia 8), av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea num\u0103rului de voturi pentru acesta \u0219i partid.
