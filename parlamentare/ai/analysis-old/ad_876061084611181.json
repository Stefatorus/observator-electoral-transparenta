The post does not refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or affiliation. While it encourages voting and implies a preference for candidates who prioritize certain issues (health, pensions, education, employment), it doesn't endorse any particular candidate or party from the provided list.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a broad audience of women aged 30-60 in Romania.  This clearly addresses the wide population, aiming for a large reach.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Partially True. The post's objective is to encourage women to vote and to influence the political agenda by highlighting their priorities. While it doesn't explicitly tell voters who to vote for, it implicitly promotes candidates who align with the stated priorities. This could be considered an indirect form of influencing the vote.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents statistics about women's priorities and encourages political participation.  It could be argued that this falls under citizen journalism, aiming to raise awareness of women's issues in the political sphere. However, the framing and call to action lean towards advocacy rather than purely objective journalism.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post doesn't express a personal opinion; rather, it presents data and advocates for a specific political agenda related to women's priorities.  It's not a personal viewpoint but a structured argument promoting a particular political stance.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>876061084611181</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post walks a fine line. It doesn't explicitly endorse any candidate, fulfilling the \"in dubio pro reo\" principle. However, by highlighting specific policy priorities and urging women to vote for candidates who share those priorities, it indirectly influences the electoral process.  The targeting of women aged 30-60 further suggests an attempt to sway a specific demographic.  The post's presentation of data, while potentially factual, is framed to support a particular political narrative, blurring the lines between advocacy and objective information.  The overall effect is to encourage voting for candidates aligned with the presented priorities, which could be interpreted as a form of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Centrul FILIA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nCentrul FILIA, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 876061084611181, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit candida\u021bi, promoveaz\u0103 indirect o agend\u0103 politic\u0103 specific\u0103 prin eviden\u021bierea unor priorit\u0103\u021bi politice (s\u0103n\u0103tate, pensii, educa\u021bie, locuri de munc\u0103) \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 femeile s\u0103 voteze candida\u021bi care \u00eemp\u0103rt\u0103\u0219esc aceste priorit\u0103\u021bi, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar prin influen\u021barea votului unui segment specific al popula\u021biei (femei cu v\u00e2rste \u00eentre 30 \u0219i 60 de ani).
