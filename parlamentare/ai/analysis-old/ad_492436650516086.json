This is not conclusive evidence of non-violation, as it could be a non-candidate related post, or the CMF might be present elsewhere in the campaign materials not included here.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any parliamentary candidate by name or clearly identifiable affiliation. The text is in an obscure, seemingly encoded language, making it impossible to determine if it refers to any specific candidate.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.  The targeting data indicates a broad reach across various age and gender demographics within Teleorman County. This satisfies the condition of addressing the public.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The decoded text mentions \"strong anti-system vote\" and parties trying to convince people of the need for \"sound visions and principles\". While this touches upon political themes, the connection to influencing votes for specific candidates is tenuous at best. The encoded nature of the text makes it difficult to definitively assess the electoral objective.  Without a clear call to action or endorsement of a specific candidate, it's difficult to definitively say that the primary objective is to influence the vote.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c is not clearly met.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post's content, even when decoded, appears more like an opinion piece or commentary on the political climate than a journalistic report.  The lack of factual information and the focus on general political trends suggest it's not primarily journalistic in nature. However, the absence of clear endorsements prevents a definitive conclusion.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Given the ambiguous nature of the encoded text, it's impossible to determine if it expresses a personal opinion or attempts to influence the vote. The decoded text seems to be a commentary on the political landscape, but without further context, it's difficult to classify it as a personal opinion.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>492436650516086</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post's encoded text prevents a definitive assessment. While the paid nature and broad targeting suggest an attempt to reach a wide audience, the lack of explicit mention of any parliamentary candidate and the ambiguous nature of the message make it difficult to classify it as electoral propaganda. The decoded text hints at political commentary, but it lacks a clear call to action or endorsement of a specific candidate.  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied here.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Total Impact</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
