The post is a public Facebook post, paid for and intended to reach a wide audience within the specified geographical targeting.

The primary objective of the post seems to be to inform the public about the local council meeting and the proposed amendments regarding local taxes. While it mentions the AUR party and their campaign promises, it does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections. The connection to the parliamentary elections is tenuous at best, and the focus remains on local issues.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents information about a local council meeting and proposed tax amendments. It could be considered a form of citizen journalism, informing the public about local political events. However, the inclusion of a comment about the AUR party's campaign promises blurs the line somewhat.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Partially True. The post expresses the author's opinion on the actions of the current mayor and the AUR party, but this opinion is presented within the context of local political events and tax policies.

While it mentions the AUR party and their campaign promises, this connection to the parliamentary elections is indirect and does not constitute electoral propaganda under Article 98 t). The post's main objective is to inform the public about local political events and proposed tax amendments, not to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections.  The mention of the AUR party is incidental to the main topic of the post.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
