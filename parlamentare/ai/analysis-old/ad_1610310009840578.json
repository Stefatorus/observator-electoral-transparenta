The post does not directly advocate for or against any candidate in the parliamentary elections.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PS News</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
