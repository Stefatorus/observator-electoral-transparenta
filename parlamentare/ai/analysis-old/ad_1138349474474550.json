While the show's content might indirectly touch upon political matters, the advertisement itself lacks any direct or indirect call to vote for or against any specific candidate in the parliamentary elections. The primary objective seems to be promoting the radio show, not influencing the election outcome.  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to definitively classify it as non-propaganda, but given the lack of direct electoral advocacy, the post is unlikely to be considered electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Bistrita FM</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
