It does not mention any political candidates, parties, or promote any electoral message. The targeting is geographically focused, but this is common for local community announcements. The content is purely informational and does not aim to influence the vote in any way.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006 and Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Vocea Botosani</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
