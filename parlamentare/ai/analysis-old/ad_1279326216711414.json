Phrases like \"Vota\u021bi echipa USR\" (Vote for the USR team) and the arguments presented (\"garan\u021bii democra\u021biei \u0219i a luptei anti-corup\u021bie\" - guarantees of democracy and the fight against corruption) directly aim to influence voting behavior.

It refers to a specific parliamentary candidate (USR), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for USR), and lacks the objectivity of journalistic reporting. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's arguments, while framed as factual claims, are presented in a persuasive manner designed to sway voters.  There are no counterarguments or alternative perspectives offered.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>USR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1279326216711414) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 USR \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru acest partid, folosind argumente persuasive \u0219i un limbaj promo\u021bional, f\u0103r\u0103 obiectivitate jurnalistic\u0103.
