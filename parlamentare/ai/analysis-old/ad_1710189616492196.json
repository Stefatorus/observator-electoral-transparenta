It refers to a specific candidate (Elena Lasconi), is intended for a wide audience, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes), and lacks journalistic neutrality. The presence of a CMF number further confirms its nature as political advertising.  The post's timing is crucial; even if the general election period has ended, the post's explicit call to vote for a specific candidate, even indirectly, is a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Elena Lasconi</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTeodor Laz\u0103r, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook cu ID-ul 1710189616492196 dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103,  men\u021bion\u00e2nd explicit \"#ElenaLasconi\" \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot cu mesajul \"Singurul antidot al fricii este VOTUL\", av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea candidatei men\u021bionate, fapt demonstrat prin prezen\u021ba num\u0103rului CMF 11240015, specific campaniilor electorale, \u0219i prin natura pl\u0103tit\u0103 a post\u0103rii.
