While the post is related to the electoral process, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  It lacks direct reference to a candidate (a), its objective is not to influence votes for a specific candidate (c), and it falls within the bounds of providing information to the public (d). The post encourages informed participation, which is a positive contribution to the democratic process, not a violation of electoral laws.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>C\u0103r\u021bure\u0219ti</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
