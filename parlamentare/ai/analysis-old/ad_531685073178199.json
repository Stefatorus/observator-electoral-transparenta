The post's language (\"Votam masiv,\" \"Votam ADN!\") directly encourages voters to support a specific candidate and party.  The targeting of the ad (Cluj County, Romania) and the use of hashtags further indicate an attempt to influence voters.  While the post doesn't explicitly violate Article 36 (7) by mentioning the candidate's name and party, the clear intention to influence the vote during the election period makes it electoral propaganda.  The post's content and context strongly suggest it aims to sway public opinion in favor of a specific candidate, fulfilling all criteria of Article 36 (7).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Emanuel Cioaca</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>FRP</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nFederatia Romanilor de Pretutindeni, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pe Facebook dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 531685073178199, care promoveaza in mod explicit candidatul Emanuel Cioaca pentru Senat din partea ADN, folosind fraze precum \"Votam masiv\" si \"Votam ADN!\", avand ca efect electoral influentarea votului in favoarea candidatului mentionat.
