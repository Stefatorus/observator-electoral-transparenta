It directly refers to a candidate (Alina Gorghiu), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by the dates), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes), and is targeted at a wide audience through paid Facebook advertising. The explicit mention of her ballot number leaves no doubt about its intention.  The fact that the post is a paid advertisement further strengthens the case for it being electoral propaganda.  While the absence of a CMF number is noteworthy, it does not negate the other strong indicators of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Alina Gorghiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Responsabilul campaniei de publicitate pe Facebook], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu scopul de a promova candidatura doamnei Alina Gorghiu la alegerile parlamentare,  prin men\u021bionarea explicit\u0103 a num\u0103rului s\u0103u de pe buletinul de vot (\"Nr. 4 pe buletinul de vot\") \u0219i prin direc\u021bionarea utilizatorilor c\u0103tre site-ul s\u0103u web, av\u00e2nd un efect electoral clar de influen\u021bare a voturilor \u00een favoarea candidatei, fapt demonstrat de con\u021binutul post\u0103rii \u0219i de datele privind bugetul alocat reclamei (RON500-RON599) \u0219i num\u0103rul de impresii (70K-80K),  cu ID-ul post\u0103rii pe Facebook 2558185481042152.\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
