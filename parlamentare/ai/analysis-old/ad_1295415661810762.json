It refers to a specific political party (PSD), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support the PSD.  The post's timing is crucial; even if the local elections are over, the post's content and intent clearly constitute electoral propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number does not negate this conclusion, as the post's content is undeniably promotional.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Gabriel Valer Zetea</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nGabriel Valer Zetea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul Social Democrat (PSD) \u0219i \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru acesta, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea PSD, fapt demonstrat prin con\u021binutul explicit al post\u0103rii (\"Vot\u0103m echilibrat, vot\u0103m PSD!\") \u0219i prin men\u021bionarea realiz\u0103rilor trecute \u0219i a promisiunilor viitoare ale PSD pentru a atrage voturi.
