It clearly identifies a candidate (Vasile Roman), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which is after the election date, this is likely a mistake in the data), has an explicitly electoral objective (to garner votes for Vasile Roman), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further reinforces this conclusion.  The post's content is not journalistic in nature; it is purely promotional.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>VASILE ROMAN</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Roman Vasile], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 930934385156486) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Vasile Roman (PSD) la alegerile parlamentare, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru acesta \u0219i prezent\u00e2nd informa\u021bii care dep\u0103\u0219esc limitele activit\u0103\u021bii jurnalistice, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea num\u0103rului de voturi pentru candidatul men\u021bionat.
