The post explicitly mentions \"Partidul S.O.S. Rom\u00e2nia\" for the parliamentary elections and \"C\u0103lin Georgescu\" for the presidential elections.

The primary objective of the post is to encourage voters to vote for specific candidates in both the parliamentary and presidential elections.

It refers to specific candidates (Partidul S.O.S. Rom\u00e2nia and C\u0103lin Georgescu), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support these candidates. The post's content is promotional, not journalistic.  The presence of a CMF, while suggesting an attempt at compliance, does not negate the promotional nature of the post.  The post's timing is also crucial; even if the presidential election is still ongoing, the parliamentary election propaganda period might have ended, making the recommendation to vote for SOS a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Partidul S.O.S.
