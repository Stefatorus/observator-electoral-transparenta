This is not conclusive evidence of non-propaganda, as it could be a post by a non-candidate or an oversight. However, its absence is a point in favor of the post not being electoral propaganda.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103\", but without further context, it's impossible to definitively determine if this is a parliamentary candidate.  The post is in Hungarian, and the name might not be immediately recognizable as a candidate from the provided list. Further investigation is needed to confirm if this person is a candidate in the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently targeting a wide audience.  The targeting parameters (cities and counties) further confirm this broad reach.  Therefore, \"Article 36 (7) - c\" regarding addressing the public is likely met.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The phrase \"Vas\u00e1rnap szavazzunk, mert k\u00e9s\u0151bb nem tudjuk befoly\u00e1solni a d\u00f6nt\u00e9seket!\" translates to \"Let's vote on Sunday, because later we cannot influence the decisions!\". This strongly suggests an electoral objective: urging people to vote. However, without knowing if Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103 is a candidate, we cannot definitively say it aims to influence votes *for a specific candidate*. The call to vote is general, not specific to a candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It lacks the characteristics of objective reporting, analysis, or opinion pieces. The imperative tone (\"Let's vote...\") is not typical of journalistic writing.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post is not a personal opinion. It's a paid advertisement with a clear call to action, aiming to influence voter behavior.  The context is political, and the message is directly related to voting.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1121225122965365</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe analysis reveals conflicting evidence. While the post targets a wide audience and contains a clear call to vote, the lack of a CMF number and the uncertainty about Alin Nicu\u0219c\u0103's candidacy prevent a definitive conclusion.  The call to vote is general, not explicitly endorsing a specific candidate.  In dubio pro reo, the evidence is insufficient to definitively classify this as electoral propaganda violating Article 98 t).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n</message-for-police>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
