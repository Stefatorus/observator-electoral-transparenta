It refers to a specific candidate (Alina Gorghiu), is used during the electoral campaign period (as indicated by the presence of a CMF number and the call to vote), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for PNL), and is disseminated to a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement.  The presence of the CMF number is particularly damning, as it is a legal requirement for campaign materials. There are no counterarguments to suggest this is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Alina Gorghiu</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103 de postare], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidata Alina Gorghiu \u0219i Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal (PNL) pentru alegerile parlamentare, cu textul explicit \u201eDuminic\u0103, vota\u021bi echipa PNL!\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea PNL, fapt demonstrat prin prezen\u021ba codului CMF: 11240002, obligatoriu pentru materialele de campanie electoral\u0103, \u0219i prin natura reclamei pl\u0103tite, adresat\u0103 unui public larg.
