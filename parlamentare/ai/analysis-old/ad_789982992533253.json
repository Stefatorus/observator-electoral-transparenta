The post's objective is to increase awareness and potentially support for Alfred Laurentiu Mihai, a candidate in the parliamentary elections.

It directly names him, states his party affiliation, and includes a call to action (\"Like Page\").  The paid nature of the advertisement and its significant reach indicate an intention to influence voters. While the post itself doesn't explicitly urge people to vote for him, its promotional nature and targeting during the election period strongly suggest it constitutes electoral propaganda.  The image shows a formal meeting, which could be interpreted as an attempt to portray the candidate as serious and competent.  The lack of a CMF number is not a decisive factor, as the other elements strongly suggest a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Alfred Laurentiu Mihai</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Alfred Laurentiu Mihai], pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu ID-ul 789982992533253, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Alfred Laurentiu Mihai, men\u021bion\u00e2ndu-l explicit ca Senator PSD - jud.
