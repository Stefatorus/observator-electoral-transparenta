While the absence of a CMF number is not automatically disqualifying, it suggests that this might not be official electoral propaganda from a registered candidate or party.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any specific parliamentary candidate by name or surname.  The post is associated with RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania), a political party, but doesn't single out any individual candidate within that party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post, being a paid Facebook advertisement, is clearly intended to reach a wide audience. The targeting parameters show a broad geographical reach across multiple Romanian counties with a significant Hungarian-speaking population. This fulfills the requirement of addressing the public at large.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary message \"VAS\u00c1RNAP SZAVAZOK!\" (Sunday, I vote!) strongly suggests an electoral objective. The accompanying text emphasizes the importance of voting for Hungarians in Romania, implying that voting for RMDSZ is crucial to their interests. This clearly aims to influence voting behavior.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The content is not journalistic in nature. While it presents an opinion, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected from journalistic reporting. The language used is highly persuasive and emotionally charged, aiming to mobilize voters rather than inform them neutrally.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it promotes a specific political party and encourages voting for it. The message is not a personal reflection but a direct call to action for electoral participation.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>467703365924245</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while not explicitly naming a candidate, promotes the RMDSZ party and directly encourages voting. The targeting parameters indicate a broad reach, and the message's persuasive and emotionally charged nature strongly suggests an intention to influence the election outcome.  The post's timing, close to election day, further strengthens this interpretation. While lacking a CMF number, the context and content strongly suggest this is electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>RMDSZ</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu mesajul \u201eVAS\u00c1RNAP SZAVAZOK!\u201d, urmat de un text care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru RMDSZ, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea electoratului maghiar din Rom\u00e2nia \u00een favoarea partidului, fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale de campanie, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024.
