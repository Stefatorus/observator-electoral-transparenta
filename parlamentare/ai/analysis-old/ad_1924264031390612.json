The presence of a CMF number, the targeting of a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and the use of language promoting specific values while criticizing the current political system all point towards electoral propaganda.  The post aims to influence voters' perceptions and potentially sway their choices, even if indirectly.  The counter-argument would be that the post is a general commentary on politics, but the context of a paid advertisement and the presence of a CMF number strongly suggest otherwise.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Cristian Terhes</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Pop Sebastian Tiberiu], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1924264031390612) cu con\u021binut electoral,  care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, face referire la PNCR \u0219i Cristian Terhes prin hashtag-urile \"#pncr#cristianterhes\" \u0219i con\u021bine un num\u0103r CMF (CMF11240003), suger\u00e2nd o leg\u0103tur\u0103 direct\u0103 cu campania electoral\u0103.
