It refers to a specific candidate (Ilie Bolojan), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as after the election, the post was active during the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for PNL), and targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  While the content is concise, it directly promotes a candidate and party, leaving no room for interpretation as anything other than electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Ilie Bolojan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 585218097425254, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Ilie Bolojan \u0219i lista PNL Bucure\u0219ti pentru alegerile parlamentare, folosind fraze precum \u201eVoteaz\u0103 lista PNL Bucure\u0219ti pentru alegerile #Parlamentare!\u201d \u0219i prezent\u00e2nd proiectul lui Ilie Bolojan \u00eentr-un mod evident electoral, cu scopul de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
