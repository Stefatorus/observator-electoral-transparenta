The post mentions Adrian Cozma, Nicolae Cornea, and Serban Zoro Calin, all seemingly associated with the PNL (National Liberal Party). While not explicitly endorsing or opposing them, the article's title (\"The trio of dubious combinations from PNL\") suggests a negative connotation and implicitly links them to questionable activities.  This could be interpreted as indirectly influencing voters' perception of these individuals and the PNL.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True.

While not explicitly urging voters to vote for or against specific candidates, the post's negative portrayal of individuals associated with the PNL could sway public opinion and indirectly influence voting choices. The timing of the post, close to the election, further strengthens this possibility.

It targets individuals associated with the PNL, using potentially biased and negative language to portray them in a unfavorable light.  The timing of the paid Facebook advertisement, close to the election, and its potential to influence voters' perceptions, suggest an intention to impact the election outcome. While not explicitly advocating for or against a candidate, the implicit negative message could be interpreted as a form of electoral propaganda.  The lack of clear journalistic objectivity and the potential for biased reporting further support this conclusion.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Adrian Cozma</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Nicolae Cornea</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Serban Zoro Calin</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nGazeta de Nord-Vest, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 427523277100495) cu con\u021binut ce prezint\u0103 \u00eentr-un mod negativ, subiectiv \u0219i tenden\u021bios, membrii PNL Adrian Cozma, Nicolae Cornea \u0219i Serban Zoro Calin,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a opiniei publice asupra acestora \u0219i a partidului, prin asocierea lor cu \u201ecombina\u021bii dubioase\u201d.
