The post mentions PSD Constanta and implicitly refers to Marcel Ciolacu,  although not by name,  as the leader of the PSD. The image also clearly shows several PSD members.  It also mentions other parties (PNL, AUR, USR) in a comparative manner.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. This is a paid Facebook post, targeting a wide audience in Constanta County,  as indicated by the ad data. The content is not a private message but is intended for public consumption.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The post aims to negatively portray the PSD Constanta branch's handling of their presidential candidate, implicitly suggesting a lack of support.  The visual contrast between the PSD and the other parties (PNL, AUR, USR) further reinforces a comparative electoral message. The headline \"Noul PSD PNL AUR USR OPRIT!\" clearly positions PSD against a coalition of other parties, influencing voters' choices.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents information, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. The language used (\"\u00eengropat,\" \"bravo,\" etc.) is highly opinionated and clearly intended to sway public opinion rather than inform impartially.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post goes beyond expressing a personal opinion; it actively promotes a negative view of a specific party and its actions, with the clear intention of influencing voters' choices in the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1106803711113491</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, paid for by \"Surse Interne,\"  meets the criteria for electoral propaganda under Article 98 t) of LEGE nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015. It directly refers to a political party (PSD) participating in the parliamentary elections, targets a wide audience in Constanta County, and has a clear electoral objective: to negatively influence voters' perception of the PSD and potentially benefit other parties by comparison. The post's language and imagery are not neutral; they are designed to evoke strong emotions and sway public opinion.  The timing of the post, after the official campaign period, further strengthens the case for a violation.  While the post doesn't explicitly endorse or discourage voting for a specific candidate, its negative portrayal of the PSD and its implied support for other parties constitutes electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Marcel Ciolacu</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Surse Interne</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSurse Interne, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1106803711113491) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 negativ\u0103 \u00eempotriva PSD, prin utilizarea unor termeni precum \u201e\u00eengropat\u201d \u0219i prin contrastarea vizual\u0103 a PSD cu alte partide (PNL, AUR, USR), av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a voturilor pentru PSD \u00een favoarea altor partide, fapt ce se \u00eencadreaz\u0103 \u00een defini\u021bia materialului de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 din Art 36 (7) din LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.
