It refers to a specific candidate (Elena Lasconi), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to choose USR. The inclusion of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing is also crucial; even if the general election period has ended, the specific timeframe of this post needs to be checked against the legal deadlines for electoral propaganda.  If this post was published after the legal deadline for electoral propaganda, it constitutes a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Elena Lasconi</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 3944305055814200, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Elena Lasconi \u0219i Partidul USR, \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot prin fraza \u201eVoteaz\u0103 USR!
