This is clearly a plea for votes, implicitly referencing the candidate himself. While the candidate's name isn't explicitly mentioned, the image clearly shows a person, and the context of the paid Facebook post strongly implies it's intended to influence voters in favor of that person.  The advertiser's name, \"David F Dragos\", further strengthens this connection.  Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a likely applies.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>Yes.

The post directly appeals for votes, targets a wide audience through paid advertising, and lacks the objectivity of journalistic reporting. The advertiser's name, \"David F Dragos\", further strengthens the connection to a political campaign.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.  While there's no explicit mention of a party, the context strongly suggests it's intended to influence the vote in favor of the individual depicted.  The provided insights data confirms the post's wide reach.  There are no counterarguments to suggest this is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>David F Dragos</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nDragos David, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 1219440599140823, care con\u021bine o imagine a sa \u0219i textul \"DAC\u0102 NU VA HOT\u0102R\u00c2\u021aI EU POT S\u0102 MAI R\u0102M\u00c2N\",  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea sa, constituind astfel propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea campaniei.
