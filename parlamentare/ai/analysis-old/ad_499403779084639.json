This strongly suggests it is electoral propaganda, as CMF numbers are used for tracking and reporting campaign spending, mandated for candidates.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>While the post doesn't explicitly name a candidate, the presence of the CMF number 11240014 strongly implies association with a specific candidate or party.  Further investigation is needed to identify the candidate associated with this CMF number.  The payer is listed as \"Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor\" (AUR), which is a political party.  This strongly suggests the post is related to a candidate from AUR.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. It's not a private message; it's public and aims for broad dissemination.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's content uses strong patriotic language (\"unim toat\u0103 suflarea rom\u00e2neasc\u0103,\" \"rescriem istoria,\" \"redob\u00e2ndirii demnit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i suveranit\u0103\u021bii na\u021bionale\") and calls for unity and action on election day (\"duminic\u0103, prin votul nostru\"). This strongly suggests the objective is to mobilize voters and influence their choices in favor of the associated candidate or party. The overall tone and message are clearly designed to encourage voting for a particular political ideology.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic content.  It's a clear appeal to emotion and national pride, not a balanced presentation of facts or different perspectives. The use of strong emotional language and calls to action are not characteristic of journalistic reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; it's a clear political message aimed at influencing voters. The language used is not personal but rather designed to appeal to a broad nationalistic sentiment.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>499403779084639</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post exhibits several characteristics of electoral propaganda. The presence of a CMF number, the association with the AUR party, the targeting of a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, the use of strong emotional appeals and calls to action, and the lack of journalistic objectivity all point towards an intention to influence voters.  While the specific candidate isn't explicitly named, the strong circumstantial evidence suggests this is electoral propaganda.  The post's timing is also crucial; if it was published after the official end of the electoral campaign period, it would be a clear violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>[Candidate's name needs further investigation based on CMF 11240014]</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Responsabilul de la Alian\u021ba pentru Unirea Rom\u00e2nilor], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 499403779084639) cu con\u021binut electoral,  care con\u021bine un num\u0103r CMF (11240014),  folose\u0219te un limbaj emo\u021bional puternic \u0219i apeluri la ac\u021biune pentru a influen\u021ba votul \u00een favoarea unui candidat AUR,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea aleg\u0103torilor \u0219i influen\u021barea deciziei lor de vot.
