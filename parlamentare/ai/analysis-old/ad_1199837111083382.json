It refers to a specific candidate, targets a wide audience, has a clear electoral objective, and is not presented as journalistic. The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing is also crucial; even if the general election period has ended, the specific campaign period for the Senate might still be ongoing, making this post a violation.  However, without knowing the exact end date of the Senate election campaign, we cannot definitively say if this is a violation of Article 98 t).  The post's content is clearly designed to promote Manolache Vasile and influence voters' choices.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>MANOLACHE VASILE</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>SOS</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1199837111083382) cu con\u021binut electoral care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui MANOLACHE VASILE la Senat \u00een jude\u021bul Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud (pozi\u021bia 8 pe buletinul de vot), av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea pozitiv\u0103 a voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
