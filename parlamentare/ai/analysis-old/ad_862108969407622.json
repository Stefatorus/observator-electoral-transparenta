It refers to a specific candidate (Florin Barbur), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as after the election, the post was active during the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Barbur), and is targeted at a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content is promotional, not journalistic.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>FLORIN BARBUR</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAtelierul de internet SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 862108969407622) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru candidatul Florin Barbur (REPER), care \u00eendepline\u0219te toate criteriile articolului 36 (7) din LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, av\u00e2nd ca scop influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestuia prin prezentarea sa ca candidat, men\u021bionarea pozi\u021biei sale pe buletinul de vot (pozi\u021bia 10) \u0219i \u00eendemnuri explicite la vot (\"Voteaz\u0103 cu \u00eencredere!
