While the post promotes voting, it does not explicitly mention any specific parliamentary candidate by name or party affiliation from the provided list. The post is in Hungarian, and refers to the general importance of voting, not a specific candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message (\"Vote on Sunday!\") is clearly intended for a wide audience, not a specific individual.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage people to vote. While it doesn't endorse a specific candidate, urging people to vote inherently influences the electoral outcome by increasing voter turnout.  The text expresses a sense of urgency and implies negative consequences for not voting.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. The post lacks the characteristics of journalistic reporting. It doesn't present factual information, analysis, or diverse perspectives. Instead, it presents a strongly opinionated call to action, urging voters to participate in the election.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses a personal opinion about the importance of voting, it goes beyond simply expressing an opinion and actively encourages a specific action (voting) with an implied political motivation. The urgency and the framing of the situation as a threat to the Hungarian minority in Romania strongly suggests an electoral objective.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>2032887200488828</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe Facebook post, while not explicitly endorsing a specific candidate, constitutes electoral propaganda. It directly encourages voting, which influences the electoral outcome. The post's message, \"Vote on Sunday!\", coupled with the accompanying text expressing concerns about the potential success of \"anti-Hungarian forces,\" creates a strong call to action with a clear political undertone.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform further strengthens the argument for it being electoral propaganda.  The fact that it is targeted at a specific demographic (Hungarian speakers in Romania) further suggests an attempt to influence the election.  While it doesn't violate Article 36 (7) - a (direct reference to a candidate), it clearly fulfills criteria b (used during the electoral campaign), c (electoral objective), and arguably d (goes beyond journalistic information).\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu mesajul \u201eVAS\u0102RNAP SZAVAZOK!\u201d, urmat de un text care exprim\u0103 \u00eengrijorare fa\u021b\u0103 de poten\u021bialul succes al unor \u201efor\u021be anti-maghiare\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea aleg\u0103torilor maghiari din Rom\u00e2nia, \u00een ciuda faptului c\u0103 perioada de campanie electoral\u0103 s-a \u00eencheiat dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024.
