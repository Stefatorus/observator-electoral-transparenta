It refers to a specific political party (PRA), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the exact end date is not specified, the context suggests it's within the campaign period), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for PRA), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting.  The paid nature of the Facebook post further strengthens the argument that it is intended for wide dissemination and electoral influence.  The fact that it mentions Mircea Geoana, likely a prominent member of the party, further reinforces its electoral nature.  The only potential mitigating factor is the absence of a CMF number, but this is not sufficient to overturn the other strong indicators of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Geoana</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>[Unspecified candidates of Partidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune Mehedin\u021bi]</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PRA</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune Mehedin\u021bi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 1328605544774777), care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la votarea Partidului Rom\u00e2nia \u00een Ac\u021biune Mehedin\u021bi \u0219i \u00eel men\u021bioneaz\u0103 pe Mircea Geoana, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea num\u0103rului de voturi pentru acest partid.
