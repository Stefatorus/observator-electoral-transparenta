The phrase \"Vom face toate acestea din Parlament, cu votul t\u0103u pe 1 Decembrie!\" (\"We will do all this in Parliament, with your vote on December 1st!\") explicitly calls for votes.

It refers to a specific candidate (Florin Barbur), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is after the election day, the post was published before), targets a wide audience, and has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes for Barbur and REPER). The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument that it's educational is weak, as the educational points are clearly used to promote the candidate's platform.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>FLORIN BARBUR</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAtelierul de internet SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 456549750804666) care constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru candidatul Florin Barbur (REPER) la alegerile parlamentare,  prin prezentarea unor propuneri de politic\u0103 educa\u021bional\u0103 \u00een mod evident orientate spre a influen\u021ba votul \u00een favoarea acestuia.
