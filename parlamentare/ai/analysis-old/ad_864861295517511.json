While the post presents itself as an interview, the subject matter focuses on a candidate's plans as a future parliamentarian.

It fulfills all criteria of Article 36 (7): it refers directly to a candidate (Silviu Co\u0219a), is published during the electoral period (though the exact date isn't specified, the ad archive suggests it was active around June 2023), has a clear electoral objective (promoting the candidate), and likely exceeds the limits of objective journalism by focusing on the candidate's plans as a future parliamentarian. The paid nature of the post on a public platform further reinforces its propagandistic intent.  The counter-argument could be that it's simply reporting on a candidate's statements, but the context and the paid nature strongly suggest an intention to influence voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Silviu Co\u0219a</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nTomis Tv, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 864861295517511) care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul PNL la Senat, Silviu Co\u0219a, prezent\u00e2ndu-i planurile ca viitor parlamentar.
