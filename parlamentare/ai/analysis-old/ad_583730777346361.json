While it doesn't name specific candidates, it strongly implies a call to action for a particular group likely aligned with a specific political party representing Hungarian interests in Romania (RMDSZ, based on the advertiser information). This indirectly refers to candidates from that party.

The phrasing \"December 1-j\u00e9n a magyarok nem vesz\u00edthetnek\" (\"On December 1st, Hungarians cannot lose\") strongly suggests an intention to influence the outcome of the election by increasing voter turnout for a particular group.

The targeting data shows a broad reach, and the message's urgency and implicit endorsement of a particular political outcome clearly aim to influence the election.  The post's content and targeting strongly suggest it's a form of electoral propaganda, even without explicitly naming candidates. The timing of the post (after the official campaign period) is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>RMDSZ Candidates</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 583730777346361) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 candida\u021bi specifici, \u00eendeamn\u0103 \u00een mod direct popula\u021bia maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia s\u0103 voteze, suger\u00e2nd implicit sprijin pentru candida\u021bii RMDSZ.
