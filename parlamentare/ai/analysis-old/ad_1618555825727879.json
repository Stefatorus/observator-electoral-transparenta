While the call to support \"preferred candidates\" could be interpreted as having an electoral objective, the overall message focuses on post-election unity and building a better future.  The lack of specific endorsements and the general nature of the call to action weaken the case for classifying it as electoral propaganda. The text is largely symbolic and patriotic, focusing on national unity.  The image of the Romanian flag further reinforces this interpretation.  The ambiguous nature of the text, combined with the lack of direct candidate mentions, makes it difficult to definitively classify this as electoral propaganda.  In dubio pro reo, we lean towards a non-violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
