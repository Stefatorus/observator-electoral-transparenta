This clearly identifies a parliamentary candidate and his affiliation with the REPER party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.

It refers directly to a candidate (Adrian Moleavin), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual legal end date for the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for REPER), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by directly advocating for a specific candidate and party.  The paid nature of the post on a public platform like Facebook further strengthens this conclusion.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to overturn the overall assessment.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Adrian Moleavin</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nREPER D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (verifica\u021bi data exact\u0103 din metadatele post\u0103rii), care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Adrian Moleavin \u0219i Partidul REPER pentru alegerile parlamentare, cu fraza \"Vota\u021bi REPER pe 1 decembrie\", av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral cre\u0219terea num\u0103rului de voturi pentru candidatul \u0219i partidul men\u021bionat, \u00een clar \u00eenc\u0103lc\u00e2nd prevederile legale privind \u00eencheierea campaniei electorale.
