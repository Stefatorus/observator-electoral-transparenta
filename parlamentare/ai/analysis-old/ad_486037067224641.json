While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to a specific candidate's official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post mentions \"szavazz\" (vote in Hungarian), implicitly encouraging voting. However, it doesn't explicitly name a specific parliamentary candidate or party.  While the advertiser is RMDSZ (Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania), a parliamentary party, the post doesn't directly advocate for them. The reference to Bagossy Norbi, a singer, is not directly linked to any candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently targeting a wide audience.  The use of hashtags further suggests an attempt to reach a broader public.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective seems to be encouraging people to vote, a general call to action rather than a specific endorsement of a candidate or party. While the RMDSZ is the advertiser, the connection to a specific candidate is tenuous. The post's overall message is generic voter mobilization, not a targeted campaign for a specific candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post doesn't present itself as journalistic. It's a short, promotional message leveraging a celebrity endorsement to encourage voting. It lacks the characteristics of objective reporting or analysis.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post doesn't express a personal opinion; it's a call to action.  The context is clearly political, but the lack of specific candidate mention weakens the argument for it being electoral propaganda.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>486037067224641</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while paid for by RMDSZ, a political party, doesn't explicitly endorse any specific parliamentary candidate.  It encourages voting generally, using a celebrity endorsement.  The lack of direct candidate mention and the generic call to action weaken the case for classifying it as electoral propaganda under Article 98 t).  While the context is political, the content itself is ambiguous and doesn't meet the criteria for direct electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post is also crucial; if it was posted after the official campaign period ended, it would be a stronger case for violation.  However, based on the provided information, the conclusion leans towards it not being a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
