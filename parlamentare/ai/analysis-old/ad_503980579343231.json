While the absence of a CMF number doesn't automatically exclude it from being considered electoral propaganda, it suggests it might not be directly linked to an officially registered candidate's campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post does not explicitly mention any specific parliamentary candidate by name or surname. The image shows two women, but they are not identified. The text \"Holnap nem vesz\u00edthet\u00fcnk\" (Tomorrow we cannot lose) is a general statement, not directly referencing a specific candidate or party.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform.  It is therefore intended to reach a wide audience, not just a specific individual or small group. This fulfills the requirement of addressing the public.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The phrase \"Holnap nem vesz\u00edthet\u00fcnk\" (Tomorrow we cannot lose) strongly suggests an electoral objective.  The timing, the day before an election, and the use of paid advertising on a public platform all point towards an attempt to mobilize voters. While no specific candidate is named, the implicit call to action aims to influence voting behavior in favor of the party associated with the advertisement (RMDSZ).</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not present itself as journalistic. It lacks the characteristics of objective reporting, analysis, or opinion pieces. The image and text are clearly designed to evoke emotion and encourage support, not to inform in a neutral manner.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The message is not a personal opinion; it's a political statement designed to influence voters. The context of a paid advertisement on Facebook during the election period makes it clear that this is not a personal expression.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>503980579343231</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly naming a candidate, strongly implies an electoral objective through its timing, messaging (\"Tomorrow we cannot lose\"), and the use of paid advertising on Facebook. The image, though not directly identifying candidates, contributes to the overall message of mobilization and support.  The targeting of Mure\u0219 County further reinforces the electoral context.  While the absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, the overall context and intent strongly suggest this is electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Unspecified RMDSZ Candidate(s) in Mure\u0219 County</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Maros Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook cu mesajul \u201eHolnap nem vesz\u00edthet\u00fcnk\u201d, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea aleg\u0103torilor \u00een favoarea candida\u021bilor RMDSZ din jude\u021bul Mure\u0219, f\u0103r\u0103 a specifica numele acestora, dar \u00eentr-un context electoral evident, dat fiind data post\u0103rii \u0219i mesajul incitativ.
