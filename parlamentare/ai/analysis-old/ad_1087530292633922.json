While the post advocates for change and criticizes established parties, it does not explicitly mention or refer to any specific parliamentary candidate by name or clearly identifiable attribute.  The hashtags used are general and do not single out a specific candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The language used (\"E timpul pentru schimbare!\", \"Rom\u00e2nia are nevoie de oameni noi\", etc.) and the call to action (\"Ie\u0219i la vot\") are clearly aimed at a broad segment of the population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>Partially True. The post's objective is to encourage voting for change and against established parties. While it doesn't explicitly endorse a specific candidate, the implicit call to vote for \"oameni noi\" could be interpreted as promoting the candidacy of individuals associated with the PNCR (Partidul Na\u021bional Conservator Rom\u00e2n), given the advertiser's affiliation.  However, this is indirect and not a direct call to vote for a specific person. The overall message focuses on broader political themes rather than a specific candidate's platform.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True. The post presents opinions and criticisms of existing political parties. While it's not strictly journalistic in style, it touches upon political issues and could be considered a form of citizen journalism or political commentary. However, the clear call to action and the overall tone suggest a persuasive intent beyond mere information dissemination.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. While the post expresses opinions, it's not a purely personal opinion piece. The structured message, the use of hashtags, and the paid advertisement format indicate an intention to influence public opinion and voting behavior, going beyond a simple expression of personal views.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1087530292633922</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post walks a fine line. It doesn't directly endorse a specific candidate, but its call for \"oameni noi\" in parliament, coupled with the advertiser's affiliation with the PNCR, creates an indirect endorsement. The timing of the post (during the electoral period) and its paid advertisement format strongly suggest an intention to influence voters.  While it doesn't explicitly violate Article 36 (7) - a (direct reference to a candidate), the indirect nature of the endorsement and the clear electoral objective (encouraging voting for change) raise concerns about compliance with Article 98 t).  The \"in dubio pro reo\" principle should be applied cautiously here, as the intent to influence the vote is evident.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PNCR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNCR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPop Sebastian Tiberiu, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul 1087530292633922, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, \u00eendeamn\u0103 la vot pentru \u201eoameni noi\u201d \u00een parlament, av\u00e2nd \u00een vedere afilierea advertiserului la PNCR, creeaz\u0103 un efect electoral pozitiv pentru acest partid.
