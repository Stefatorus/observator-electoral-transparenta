It refers to a specific parliamentary candidate (Larisa Blanari), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and aims to positively influence voters' perception of the candidate to increase votes.  The absence of a CMF number is not sufficient to negate these factors.  The content is promotional, not journalistic.  The post's timing is crucial; even if the official campaign period has ended, posting this after the deadline is a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Larisa Blanari</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInformatia ta, pentru incalcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 a unei reclame pe Facebook (ID postare: 607073918491384) care promoveaza candidatul PSD Larisa Blanari la Camera Deputatilor, continand afirmatii cu scop electoral (\"Eu nu sunt de v\u00e2nzare \u0219i cred c\u0103 asta e marele meu avantaj!\"),  avand ca efect electoral cresterea popularitatii si a voturilor pentru candidata mentionata, in clar incalcarea prevederilor legale privind incetarea campaniei electorale.
