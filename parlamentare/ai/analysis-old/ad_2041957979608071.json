It refers directly to a political party (PNL), is used in a period likely after the official campaign period (judging by the date), has a clear electoral objective (persuading voters to vote for PNL), and is addressed to the wide public via a paid Facebook advertisement. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument that it's the mayor's personal opinion is weak, as the post is clearly designed as a political advertisement.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Mircea Minea</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>PNL</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Entitatea responsabil\u0103 de postare], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 2041957979608071), care promoveaz\u0103 Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal (PNL) \u0219i pe Mircea Minea, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
