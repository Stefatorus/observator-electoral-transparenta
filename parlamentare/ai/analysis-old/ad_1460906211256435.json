While it mentions their official roles (Primar and Senator), this is clearly in the context of promoting them as candidates associated with the PNL party.  The image reinforces this by prominently displaying the PNL logo.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>TRUE: This is a paid Facebook post, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.

It directly refers to candidates (Gabriel Pan\u0103 and Maria Gabriela Horga), uses visual elements (PNL logo) and text (\"Pentru Familie, Comunitate, \u021aar\u0103\") to promote them, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook campaign, and has a clear electoral objective (influencing voters). The presence of the CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak; the mention of their official roles is clearly within the context of promoting their candidacy.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Gabriel Pan\u0103</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Maria Gabriela Horga</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PNL</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nCosmin Radoi, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1460906211256435) cu caracter de propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103, care promoveaz\u0103 candida\u021bii Gabriel Pan\u0103 \u0219i Maria Gabriela Horga de la PNL, folosind imagini, text \u0219i num\u0103rul CMF 11240002, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestora.
