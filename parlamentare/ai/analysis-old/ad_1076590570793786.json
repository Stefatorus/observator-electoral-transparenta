The post's timing, close to the election, and its clear intention to influence voters strongly suggest it constitutes electoral propaganda. While it doesn't explicitly name all candidates, the context and linked article clearly favor AUR. The post fulfills the criteria of Article 36 (7) a, b, and c of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak; it's not a neutral opinion piece but a clear attempt to sway voters.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Cristian Catan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>AUR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAUR - S\u0103la\u0219u de Sus, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 1076590570793786) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care con\u021bine propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 pentru AUR \u0219i candidatul s\u0103u Cristian Catan, critic\u00e2nd coali\u021bia PSD-PNL-USR \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru AUR.
