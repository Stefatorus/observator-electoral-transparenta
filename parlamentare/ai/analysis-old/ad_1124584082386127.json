While Marcu holds a political office, the post's content is not related to the parliamentary elections. It focuses on national unity and celebration, not on influencing voters.  The mention of Marcu is incidental and does not constitute electoral propaganda. The post does not meet the criteria of Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, as it does not directly refer to a parliamentary candidate, does not have an electoral objective, and does not exceed the limits of journalistic information.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Moldova Invest</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
