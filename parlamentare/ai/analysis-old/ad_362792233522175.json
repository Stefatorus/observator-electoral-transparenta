The post's objective is to influence public opinion regarding AUR.

It directly refers to AUR, a parliamentary candidate, and aims to influence voters' perceptions of the party by highlighting a controversial statement made by its leader. The post uses a public figure's opinion to achieve this, making it a clear attempt to influence the vote. The fact that it's a paid advertisement on a public platform further strengthens the argument that it's intended for wide dissemination and electoral impact.  While the post presents information, it lacks the objectivity and neutrality of journalistic reporting, instead focusing on a single, potentially damaging, statement to create a narrative that could influence voters' choices.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>AUR</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Info360</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nInfo360, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024 (ID postare: 362792233522175), care face referire direct\u0103 la AUR, un candidat la alegerile parlamentare, prezent\u00e2nd o declara\u021bie controversat\u0103 a liderului partidului, Simion, \u0219i asociind-o cu dezaprobarea manelistului Dani Mocanu, cu scopul clar de a influen\u021ba negativ percep\u021bia publicului asupra AUR \u0219i, implicit, votul aleg\u0103torilor.
