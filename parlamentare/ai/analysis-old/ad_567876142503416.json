While the proposal itself is a matter of public interest, the post's context and framing clearly aim to influence voters' perception of the candidate.  The post is published during the electoral campaign period, directly relates to the candidate's political aspirations, targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and explicitly seeks public support for the proposal, which directly benefits the candidate's image and electability.  The lack of journalistic objectivity and the clear intention to garner electoral support outweigh any potential argument for it being merely a statement of personal opinion or a piece of citizen journalism.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate>\n    <name>Sebastian Tiberiu Pop</name>\n    <impact>POSITIVE</impact>\n  </candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\n[Sebastian - Tiberiu Pop], pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 567876142503416) care promoveaz\u0103 o ini\u021biativ\u0103 legislativ\u0103 a candidatului, prezent\u00e2ndu-se ca viitor deputat \u0219i solicit\u00e2nd sus\u021binerea publicului pentru aceasta.
