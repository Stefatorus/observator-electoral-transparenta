The post explicitly mentions \"Dumitru Rujan\" as a candidate, implicitly referring to himself as a candidate for the parliamentary elections.

This could be interpreted as an attempt to connect with a specific demographic (workers).</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience.

The core message of the post is to encourage voters to support Dumitru Rujan in the upcoming elections.  Phrases like \"alege-ne s\u0103 lupt\u0103m cu adev\u0103rat pentru tine\" (choose us to truly fight for you) and the promises of support for entrepreneurs strongly suggest an electoral objective.

It directly refers to a candidate (Dumitru Rujan), is used during the electoral campaign period (as evidenced by the \"Pe 1 Decembrie, ie\u0219i la vot!\" call to action), has a clear electoral objective (to garner votes for Dumitru Rujan), and targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement. The content goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by focusing on promises and achievements to promote the candidate.  The image accompanying the post further reinforces this by showing the candidate in a relatable setting, likely aiming to connect with a specific voter demographic.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Dumitru Rujan</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nDumitru Rujan, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 1235337024405561, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura sa la alegerile parlamentare prin afirma\u021bii precum \"alege-ne s\u0103 lupt\u0103m cu adev\u0103rat pentru tine\" \u0219i promisiuni de sprijin pentru antreprenori, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea sa.
