While the absence of a CMF number is not automatically disqualifying, it suggests the post might not be directly linked to a specific candidate's official campaign.</has-cmf>\n<refers-to-candidate>The post refers to the PSD (Partidul Social Democrat) party, but it does not mention any specific candidate by name or surname.  It uses the party's name and logo implicitly, but doesn't directly mention any individual candidate participating in the parliamentary elections. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - a does not strictly apply.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, targeting a wide audience in Vrancea County.  The use of a paid advertisement on a public platform like Facebook clearly indicates an intention to reach a broad audience, not just a select few. Therefore, it addresses the wide population.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The post's primary message is a call to vote on December 1st. While it doesn't explicitly state \"vote for PSD,\" the implicit encouragement to vote, coupled with the clear affiliation with the PSD party, strongly suggests an electoral objective. The timing (close to the election) and the targeting of a specific county further reinforce this interpretation. Therefore, Article 36 (7) - c applies.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post lacks journalistic elements such as factual reporting, analysis, or diverse perspectives. It's a simple, direct call to action, lacking the characteristics of journalistic content.  It does not aim to educate or inform in a neutral manner.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it promotes a political party.  The content is not an expression of personal views but a clear attempt to influence voting behavior.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>1723851535114433</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post, while not explicitly mentioning a specific candidate, is strongly associated with the PSD party through its imagery, text, and the advertiser's identity. The call to vote, coupled with the timing and targeting, strongly suggests an intention to influence voters in favor of the PSD.  The absence of a CMF number weakens the direct link to a specific candidate, but the overall context points towards electoral propaganda.  The post's design and message are clearly aimed at mobilizing voters for the PSD, even without explicitly naming a candidate.  The argument against it being propaganda is weak, as the implicit call to vote for the PSD is undeniable.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>PSD</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>PSD</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nPartidul Social Democrat - Filiala Vrancea, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu mesajul  \u201eTe a\u0219tept\u0103m pe 1 decembrie la vot!\u201d,  \u00eenso\u021bit de logo-ul PSD, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral mobilizarea electoratului \u00een favoarea PSD Vrancea, f\u0103r\u0103 a men\u021biona candida\u021bi specifici, dar cu o leg\u0103tur\u0103 implicit\u0103 evident\u0103 cu partidul, fapt ce constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 interzis\u0103 dup\u0103 \u00eencheierea perioadei legale de campanie.
