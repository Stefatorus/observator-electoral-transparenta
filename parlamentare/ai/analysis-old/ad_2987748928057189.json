It refers to a specific candidate (Florin Barbur), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes for REPER), and surpasses the boundaries of objective journalistic reporting. The presence of the CMF number further reinforces its nature as electoral propaganda.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is also a crucial factor.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>FLORIN BARBUR</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>REPER</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAtelierul de internet SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 2987748928057189) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui FLORIN BARBUR pentru Partidul REPER \u00een jude\u021bul Maramure\u0219,  folosind fraze precum \u201eVoteaz\u0103 pozi\u021bia 10 pe buletinul de vot!\u201d \u0219i \u201eTe \u00eendemn s\u0103 votezi cu \u00eencredere partidul REPER\u201d, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea candidatului \u0219i partidului men\u021bionat, \u00een clar\u0103 \u00eenc\u0103lcare a prevederilor legale privind perioada de campanie electoral\u0103.
