It refers to a specific candidate (Petru Farago), is used during the electoral campaign (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which corresponds to November 23, 2024, and the post was likely made before the end of the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Farago), and is not journalistic in nature. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's targeting data indicates it is intended for a wide audience.  There are no counterarguments to suggest this is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>PETRU FARAGO</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nSC KLING CONSULTING SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 2632021697008160) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui PETRU FARAGO pentru UDMR la Camera Deputa\u021bilor, eviden\u021biind pozi\u021bia sa pe buletinul de vot \u0219i utiliz\u00e2nd imaginea sa, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea voturilor \u00een favoarea acestuia.
