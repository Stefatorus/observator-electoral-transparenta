It refers to a specific candidate (Manolache Vasile), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to participate in the election, strongly implying a positive endorsement of the candidate.  The post's timing, after the official campaign period, is a crucial factor.  While the post itself doesn't explicitly urge voters to vote *for* Manolache Vasile, the implicit endorsement and call to action (\"come to the polls and be part of the change!\") are sufficient to constitute electoral propaganda.  The absence of a CMF number is not a decisive factor in this case, given the other strong indicators of electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>MOMENTUM</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1210400386734563) care promoveaz\u0103 implicit candidatul Manolache Vasile la alegerile parlamentare,  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea acestuia.
