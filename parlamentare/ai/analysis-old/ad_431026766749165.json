While the post is clearly related to the Romanian parliamentary elections and targets the Hungarian minority, it does not explicitly mention any specific candidate by name or party affiliation.  The post promotes voting in general terms, urging the Hungarian community to participate to protect their interests. It does not endorse or oppose any particular candidate.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>True. The post is a paid advertisement on Facebook, a public platform, and its message is clearly intended to reach a wide audience within the Hungarian community in Bihor County, Romania. The language used (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\", \"Rajtad m\u00falik\", \"Csak egy\u00fctt tudjuk megv\u00e9deni\") suggests a broad appeal.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>True. The primary objective of the post is to encourage a specific segment of the population (Hungarian speakers in Bihor County) to vote in the parliamentary elections. The message emphasizes the importance of their participation to safeguard their interests, implying that not voting could have negative consequences. This constitutes an attempt to influence the outcome of the election, even without explicitly endorsing a candidate.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>False. While the post presents information about the election (voting location), it lacks the objectivity and neutrality expected of journalistic reporting. The language is highly emotive and persuasive, aiming to mobilize voters rather than providing neutral information. The framing of the situation (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\") is clearly biased and intended to sway opinion.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>False. The post does not express a personal opinion; instead, it presents a political message aimed at influencing voter behavior.

It targets the parliamentary elections by urging a specific demographic to vote, framing the election as a crucial moment for their community's survival. The emotive language and call to action (\"SZAVAZZ TE IS!\") clearly aim to influence voter behavior.  Although no candidate is named, the implicit message is that voting is essential to protect the Hungarian community's interests, thus indirectly influencing the election's outcome. The post's paid nature on a public platform further strengthens its classification as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>RMDSZ</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ Bihar Megye, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 431026766749165) dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care, de\u0219i nu men\u021bioneaz\u0103 explicit un candidat, constituie propagand\u0103 electoral\u0103 prin \u00eendemnul la vot adresat comunit\u0103\u021bii maghiare din jude\u021bul Bihor, folosind un limbaj emotiv \u0219i apeluri la ac\u021biune (\"Vesz\u00e9lyben vagyunk!\", \"SZAVAZZ TE IS!\") pentru a influen\u021ba comportamentul electoral.
