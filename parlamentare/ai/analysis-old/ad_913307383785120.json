The final statement \"Eu vreau s\u0103 r\u0103m\u00e2n \u00een EUROPA!\" hints at a political stance, further suggesting a connection to the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently targeting a wide audience.

The repeated calls to \"NU VOTA\u021aI\" and the critique of AI-generated illusions strongly suggest an attempt to dissuade voters from supporting a specific candidate or party. The message aims to create a negative perception of a certain type of political communication, implicitly influencing the vote.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards. While it presents a narrative, it lacks objectivity and is clearly intended to persuade rather than inform. The emotional language and subjective opinions presented do not align with neutral reporting.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Although the post is framed as a personal anecdote, its clear intention is not merely to express a personal opinion but to sway public opinion against a particular type of political campaign. The narrative serves as a vehicle for delivering a political message aimed at influencing the election.</personal_opinion>\n</analysis>\n\n<conclusion>\n<post_id>913307383785120</post_id>\n<electoral-propaganda-analysis>\nThe post exhibits characteristics of electoral propaganda. The presence of a CMF number, the clear attempt to influence voters against a certain type of campaign (implicitly against specific candidates), the use of a paid Facebook advertisement to reach a wide audience, and the lack of journalistic objectivity all point towards a violation.  While no specific candidate is named, the indirect nature of the attack, coupled with the clear political message and the use of paid advertising, makes it highly likely that this post aims to influence the outcome of the parliamentary elections. The argument that it's a personal opinion is weak, given the clear political context and the use of paid advertising to disseminate the message.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Unspecified</name><impact>NEGATIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>INDEPENDENT</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nAlexandru Rogobete, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 913307383785120) cu con\u021binut electoral, care \u00eendeamn\u0103 la nevotarea unor candida\u021bi nepreciza\u021bi, dar identifica\u021bi implicit prin critica utiliz\u0103rii inteligen\u021bei artificiale \u00een campania electoral\u0103, av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea negativ\u0103 a votului, prin utilizarea unui mesaj emo\u021bional \u0219i subiectiv, care nu respect\u0103 standardele jurnalistice obiective, \u0219i prin prezen\u021ba unui num\u0103r CMF (CMF11240017), indic\u00e2nd clar natura electoral\u0103 a post\u0103rii.
