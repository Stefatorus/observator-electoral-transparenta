The paid nature of the Facebook post, targeting a wide audience in Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County and surrounding areas, and the clear connection between the promoted values and the candidate's platform, strongly suggest this is electoral propaganda.  The timing of the post, considering the provided end date, needs to be checked against the official end date of the electoral campaign. If the post was published after the legal deadline for electoral propaganda, it would constitute a violation.  The absence of a CMF number is a mitigating factor, but not sufficient to negate the overall promotional nature of the post.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Manolache Vasile</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>MOMENTUM</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nMomentum Motion Pictures SRL, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook (ID postare: 1746697239416114) care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul la Senat Manolache Vasile,  prin asocierea valorilor sale (familie, respect, con\u0219tiin\u021b\u0103) cu un apel implicit la vot (\"Pe 1 decembrie, hai s\u0103 vot\u0103m pentru un viitor construit pe valori reale \u2013 familie, respect \u0219i con\u0219tiin\u021b\u0103\").
