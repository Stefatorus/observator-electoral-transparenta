It refers to a specific parliamentary candidate (UDMR), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has a clear electoral objective: to persuade voters to support the UDMR. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The argument that it's simply expressing an opinion is weak, given the clear political context and the use of campaign hashtags.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Uniunea Democrat\u0103 Maghiar\u0103 din Rom\u00e2nia (UDMR)</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>UDMR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nRMDSZ/UDMR, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID: 3942630265974085) cu con\u021binut electoral,  care promoveaz\u0103 UDMR prin mesajul \"Cet\u0103\u021beanul s\u0103 nu mai fie sanc\u021bionat prin impozit\u0103ri care sfideaz\u0103 ra\u021biunea.
