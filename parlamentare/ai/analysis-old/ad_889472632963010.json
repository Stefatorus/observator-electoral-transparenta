It refers to a candidate (Brian Cristian), is targeted at a wide audience via a paid Facebook advertisement, has a clear electoral objective (influencing votes), and does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's timing is crucial; even if the official campaign period has ended, posting this after the legal deadline is a violation.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR Maramures</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea unei reclame pl\u0103tite pe Facebook dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, cu ID-ul post\u0103rii 889472632963010, care promoveaz\u0103 direct candidatul Brian Cristian, eviden\u021biind activitatea sa parlamentar\u0103 pentru a influen\u021ba votul aleg\u0103torilor.
