The post details the scale of the campaign (planting approximately 3 million saplings across 2,096 hectares), highlights specific planting activities in Ialomi\u021ba county, and provides broader context on Romsilva's afforestation efforts over the past five years. The content is factual, descriptive, and focuses on environmental and forestry matters. There is no mention of any political candidate, party, or any attempt to influence voters' choices in any election. The hashtags used (#P\u0103duri, #DezvoltareDurabil\u0103, #Conteaz\u0103PentruViitor, #Silvicultur\u0103, etc.) further reinforce the post's focus on environmental and forestry themes.  While the post is a paid advertisement, its objective is clearly to inform the public about Romsilva's activities, not to promote any political agenda.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined by Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Regia Nationala a Padurilor - Romsilva</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
