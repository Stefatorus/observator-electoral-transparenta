While not explicitly stating his party affiliation within the post itself, the \"USR Maramures\" byline strongly implies he is a USR candidate. The post encourages voters to vote for candidates who will be their voice in Parliament. This directly relates to the parliamentary elections.</refers-to-candidate>\n<addresses-the-wide-population>The post is a paid Facebook advertisement, inherently designed to reach a wide audience. The use of hashtags and the general message are aimed at a broad public, not a specific individual or small group.</addresses-the-wide-population>\n<electoral-objective>The primary objective of the post is to positively influence voters' opinions of Brian Cristian and encourage them to vote for him in the upcoming parliamentary elections.  The post highlights his achievements (\"largest presence,\" \"most legislative initiatives,\" \"most time speaking\") to present him favorably. The call to action (\"vote for candidates who will be your voice\") directly aims to influence voting behavior.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>The post does not adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity and impartiality.

It refers directly to a candidate (Brian Cristian), is used during the electoral campaign period (although the end date is given as 1732867200, which needs to be checked against the actual election date to confirm if it's after the official end of the campaign), has a clear electoral objective (to increase votes for Brian Cristian), and goes beyond simple journalistic reporting by presenting biased information to promote the candidate. The presence of the CMF number further solidifies its nature as electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate> <name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 1043264764266897) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatul Brian Cristian, prezent\u00e2ndu-l \u00eentr-o lumin\u0103 favorabil\u0103 \u0219i \u00eendemn\u00e2nd la vot pentru acesta.
