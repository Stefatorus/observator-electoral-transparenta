The post is a public Facebook post from a verified organization's page, aiming to reach a wide audience.

The primary objective of the post is to raise awareness about a concerning rise in hate speech and a proposed legislative initiative perceived as anti-democratic and discriminatory. While the context is the aftermath of presidential elections, the post doesn't directly advocate for or against any specific candidate or party. The call to action is for civic engagement and rejection of hate speech, not a specific voting choice.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Partially True.
