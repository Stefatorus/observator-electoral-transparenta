It refers directly to a candidate (Brian Cristian), targets a wide audience through a paid Facebook advertisement, and has the clear objective of influencing voters to support him in the parliamentary elections. The presence of a CMF number further strengthens this conclusion.  The post's content, while including some factual data, is overwhelmingly promotional in nature and lacks the objectivity expected of journalistic reporting.  The mention of Elena Lasconi serves to bolster the campaign message, not to provide an independent political commentary.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>TRUE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n  <candidate><name>Brian Cristian</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n  <candidate><name>Elena Lasconi</name><impact>POSITIVE</impact></candidate>\n</electoral-propaganda-candidates>\n<responsible-party-or-group>USR</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police>\nUSR Maramure\u0219, pentru \u00eenc\u0103lcarea articolului 98 t) din LEGEA nr. 208 din 20 iulie 2015, prin publicarea, dup\u0103 ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, a unei post\u0103ri pe Facebook (ID 472301982091367) cu con\u021binut electoral, care promoveaz\u0103 candidatura lui Brian Cristian la alegerile parlamentare \u0219i con\u021bine \u00eendemnuri explicite la vot (\"Vota\u021bi reprezentan\u021bi care muncesc pentru voi\", \"Candidez pentru un nou mandat\", \"V\u0103 \u00eendemn s\u0103 m\u0103 sus\u021bine\u021bi\"),  precum \u0219i un num\u0103r CMF (CMF 11240015),  av\u00e2nd ca efect electoral influen\u021barea votului \u00een favoarea candidatului Brian Cristian \u0219i, indirect, Elena Lasconi,  \u00een clar\u0103 \u00eenc\u0103lcare a prevederilor legale privind perioada de campanie electoral\u0103.
