While the post falls under the \"POLITICAL\" category, its objective is not explicitly to influence the vote for or against any particular candidate in the parliamentary elections. The content seems geared towards gathering and presenting public opinion, which is not inherently an electoral objective in itself. The website linked, \"opinia-cetateanului.ro\" (citizen's opinion), further suggests a focus on general political discourse rather than electoral campaigning.</electoral-objective>\n<journalism>Potentially True.  The post's description and the website name suggest an attempt at citizen journalism or public opinion analysis. However, without access to the actual content of the post (only the image URLs are provided), a definitive conclusion cannot be reached. The images might contain content that could be considered propaganda, but this cannot be determined without viewing them.</journalism>\n<personal_opinion>Not applicable.

The post is categorized as \"POLITICAL,\" but it does not explicitly endorse or oppose any specific parliamentary candidate. The objective seems to be gathering and presenting public opinion, which is not directly prohibited by the law.  The lack of a CMF number and the absence of direct references to candidates further support this conclusion. However, a definitive assessment requires reviewing the actual content of the post and the images linked. The images could potentially contain elements that would change this assessment.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>Opinia Cet\u0103\u021beanului</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>\n```\n"
