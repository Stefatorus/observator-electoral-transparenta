The content is informative and does not advocate for or against any political candidate or party participating in the parliamentary elections. The post does not meet the criteria for electoral propaganda as defined in Article 36 (7) of LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006.  It does not directly refer to a candidate (a), its objective is educational, not electoral (c), and it does not exceed the limits of journalistic information (d). The timing of the post, after the official campaign period, is irrelevant because it is not electoral propaganda.\n</electoral-propaganda-analysis>\n<electoral-propaganda-decision>FALSE</electoral-propaganda-decision>\n<electoral-propaganda-candidates/>\n<responsible-party-or-group>EM360</responsible-party-or-group>\n<message-for-police/>\n</conclusion>\n</output>"
