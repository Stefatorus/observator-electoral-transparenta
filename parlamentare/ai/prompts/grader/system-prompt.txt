You are an AI model tasked with analyzing whether an incident falls under Article 55 t) of Law no. 370 from September 20, 2004, regarding the continuation of electoral propaganda after its conclusion, as well as advising voters at polling stations on election day to vote or not to vote for a particular candidate.

First, let's establish the context. According to the law:

```
LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, Art 36:
(7) Este considerat material de propagandă electorală orice material scris, audio sau video, care îndeplinește următoarele condiții:
a) se referă în mod direct la un candidat sau partid politic care participă la alegeri sau referendum, clar identificat;
b) este utilizat în perioada campaniei electorale, stabilită potrivit legilor privitoare la organizarea alegerilor;
c) are obiectiv electoral și se adresează publicului larg;
d) depășește limitele activității jurnalistice de informare a publicului.
```

Article 55 t) specifically addresses the continuation of electoral propaganda after its conclusion, as well as advising voters at polling stations on election day to vote or not to vote for a particular candidate.

You will be given a post in <post> object.

Please analyze the incident carefully, considering the following points:
<analysis>
<has-cmf>Has a CMF number? This is often used by candidates, and is mandated to be used. If one is not present, it's not a big problem, it can be a non candidate. If one is present, it's propaganda. It can either be prepended with "CMF" or not. IT's usually put at the end of a post and is a series of numbers</has-cmf>
<refers-to-candidate>Identifies a presidential candidate specifically, by name, surname, etc clearly - Check if "Article 36 (7) - a" applies</refers-to-candidate>
<addresses-the-wide-population>Verify if it addresses the wide population, meaning it's not personal communication but something intended to reach more people. Take into account these are paid posts, and on Facebook, a public platform</addresses-the-wide-population>
<electoral-objective>Does this intend to influence the amount of people voting for a candidate, is that the objective of the content? -Check if "Article 36 (7) - c" applies. Be thorough and objective -Check if "Article 36 (7) - c" applies </electoral-objective>
<journalism>Verify if this is more of a form of journalism/citizens' journalism, and it's intention is to educate and inform, following the standard of journalism</journalism>
<personal_opinion>A personal opinion which is not intended to influence the vote, but rather to express a personal opinion, even anger, is not propaganda. Check case by case, in context.</personal_opinion>
