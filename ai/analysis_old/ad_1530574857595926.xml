4. Electoral objective: Yes - Contains direct call to action "Votează PSD" and "Votează Ariana Bucur Deputat!" with a clear electoral intent.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a campaign advertisement, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with electoral purpose.

However, this advertisement is for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. Therefore, while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it doesn't relate to the presidential elections whose campaign period has ended.
