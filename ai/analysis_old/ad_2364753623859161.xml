While this is clearly political communication (evidenced by the CMF number and content), it appears to be focused on party building and local politics rather than the presidential election. The content discusses past work in Sibiu County Council and aims to attract liberal voters to Forța Dreptei, but does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election.
