This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The post promotes USR's healthcare program and vision for governance, using campaign messaging and official campaign identifiers (CMF number). However, since this is for parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period, this type of propaganda is allowed.

The post doesn't violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It doesn't promote any presidential candidate
2. It focuses on parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period
3. It doesn't attempt to influence voters at polling stations
