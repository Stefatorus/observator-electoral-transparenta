Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: This post does not specifically mention any presidential candidates. It focuses on local projects for Băilești municipality and mentions PSD parliamentarians in general.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a significant audience (estimated 10,001-50,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The post ends with "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Băilești!" which is clearly electoral messaging, but for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material presenting future projects and promises.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj.

The key point here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, 2024, which are still in their legal campaign period. It does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election.
