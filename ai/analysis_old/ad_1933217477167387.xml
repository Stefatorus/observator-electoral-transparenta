Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: While the post primarily discusses Schengen accession, it clearly positions Marcel Ciolacu as a successful leader achieving important national objectives
5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a political achievement announcement with clear party affiliation
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Salaj)

The post combines a policy achievement announcement with political promotion. While it discusses the Schengen accession, it specifically attributes the success to PSD and Marcel Ciolacu, a presidential candidate, during the election period when propaganda is not allowed.

Key factors indicating this is electoral propaganda:
- Presence of CMF number
- Direct mention of presidential candidate Marcel Ciolacu
- Attribution of success to PSD and Ciolacu specifically
- Paid distribution after campaign period
- Party affiliation clear in byline
