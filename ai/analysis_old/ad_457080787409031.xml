This post presents a complex case:

- However, the linked content references Elena Lasconi (presidential candidate)
- The mention of Lasconi is incidental and not the main focus of the advertisement
- The primary purpose is to promote a Senate candidate

</conclusion>

While the post does contain a reference to a presidential candidate in its linked content, the primary focus and purpose of the advertisement is to promote a Senate candidate during the ongoing parliamentary campaign period. The mention of Elena Lasconi is incidental and not the main focus of the propaganda effort. Therefore, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004.
