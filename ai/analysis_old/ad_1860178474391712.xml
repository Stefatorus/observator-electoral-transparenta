Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Simion" and "Sergiu Mihalcea" specifically. However, this appears to be focused on parliamentary elections (Senate candidate) rather than presidential elections.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, it clearly has an electoral objective, calling for votes for Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate and promoting AUR's economic platform.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official campaign message from "Antreprenorii de AUR".

The important distinction here is that while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's focused on the parliamentary elections (Senate candidate Sergiu Mihalcea) rather than the presidential election. The mention of "Planul Simion" is in context of party policy rather than direct presidential campaigning.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Simion is in context of party policy rather than presidential candidacy. The main call to action is for voting Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate.
