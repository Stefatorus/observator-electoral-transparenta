1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is present in the post

2. Reference to Candidates:
- The post mentions Viktor Orbán (Hungarian PM) thanking UDMR for their work
- While UDMR's Kelemen Hunor is a presidential candidate, he is not directly mentioned

- It's published on both Facebook and Instagram
- It ends with "Oszd meg!" (Share it!)
- Clearly intended for mass distribution

4. Electoral Objective:
- While it presents a positive message about UDMR's work
- It's focused on Schengen achievement rather than explicit electoral messaging
- However, timing during election period is suspicious

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:

This case presents a subtle form of electoral propaganda because:

- Promotes UDMR's achievements
- Uses foreign leadership endorsement
- Calls for sharing
However, it doesn't directly mention presidential elections or explicitly call for votes.
