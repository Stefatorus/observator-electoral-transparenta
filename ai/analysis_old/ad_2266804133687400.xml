<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, the post contains "CMF 11240003" which indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to candidate: While this is from PNCR (Partidul Național Conservator Român), which has CRISTIAN-VASILE TERHEȘ as a presidential candidate, the post itself doesn't directly mention him or any other candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram targeting a potentially large audience (100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: The message is generic political communication about change and community values. While it has political content, it's not specifically related to the presidential elections.

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalism but rather a political message.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion.

The post appears to be general political messaging rather than specific presidential campaign propaganda. While it uses a CMF number (suggesting it's part of an electoral campaign), it could be related to the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.
