Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is visible in the post

2. Refers to candidate:
- Yes, mentions "Planul Simion" (referring to George-Nicolae Simion, a presidential candidate)
- Also mentions Mihail Neamțu as parliamentary candidate

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram
- Targets a large audience (estimated >1 million people)
- Specifically addresses voters in Bihor

4. Electoral objective:
- Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează")
- Promotes both Simion's plan and Neamțu's parliamentary candidacy

5. Journalism:
- No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion:
- No, this is official party communication (AUR Bihor)

The important distinction here is that while this post mentions Simion, it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is in context of parliamentary policy, not specifically his presidential campaign.

This case presents an interesting overlap between parliamentary and presidential campaigns. While Simion is mentioned, the primary focus and call to action is for the parliamentary candidate Mihail Neamțu. The parliamentary campaign is still legally ongoing, making this aspect legitimate. However, any presidential campaign activity is prohibited at this time.

</conclusion>

The post does not violate Article 55 t) because:
1. Its primary focus is the parliamentary election, which is still in legal campaign period
2. The reference to Simion is indirect and in context of party policy rather than presidential candidacy
3. The call to action is specifically for the parliamentary candidate
