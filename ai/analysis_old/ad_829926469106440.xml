Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" directly
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (15,000-19,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: The post appears to have a dual nature:
   - Promotes parliamentary elections (which is still allowed)
   - References Marcel Ciolacu's achievements, who is a presidential candidate
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an organized campaign post with CMF number

The post is complicated because it mixes parliamentary election campaign (which is still allowed) with promotion of Marcel Ciolacu's achievements as PSD leader. The mention of Ciolacu's "realizările din timpul guvernării" (achievements during governance) in the context of current elections could be seen as indirect presidential campaign material.
