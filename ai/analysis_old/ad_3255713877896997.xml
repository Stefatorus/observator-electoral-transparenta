1. Has CMF: Yes, the post includes a CUI mandatar financiar number (11240017)

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions support for PSD Gorj candidates for Senate and Chamber of Deputies, but does not mention any presidential candidates from our provided list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with an estimated reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The message clearly supports PSD candidates for Parliament.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message from a PSD mayor supporting his party's parliamentary candidates.

6. Personal opinion: While it includes a personal statement from Mayor Constantin DrÄƒghici-Rucsanda, it's clearly structured as campaign material, evidenced by the official party disclaimer and CUI number.

Key observations:

- Properly marked as campaign material with mandatar financiar
