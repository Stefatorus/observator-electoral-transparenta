Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240022" which indicates this is electoral propaganda material

2. Refers to candidate: The post is from Constantin Stăvărache, who appears to be running for a local/parliamentary position. It does not mention or refer to any presidential candidates from our list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting Teleorman county, with an estimated reach of 50,001-100,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this is clearly electoral content as:
- It presents a political platform
- Discusses future plans for a 4-year term
- Mentions being part of "Alianța Forțelor de Dreapta"
- Uses CMF number
- Targets a specific geographical area (Teleorman)

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalism but rather a direct campaign message from a candidate.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message presenting political objectives and promises.

However, this appears to be for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections, which means it's currently allowed as the parliamentary election campaign period is still ongoing.
