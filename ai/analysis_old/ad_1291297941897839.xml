<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda, but it's ALLOWED because:
- It primarily promotes a parliamentary candidate (Sergiu Mihalcea for Senate)
- The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing
- While it mentions Simion, it's in context of a party plan, not primarily promoting his presidential candidacy
