Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: This post does not directly name any presidential candidates. However, it's promoting USR as a party.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people in Caraș-Severin, clearly addressing the wide public.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message "Pe cine votezi sa te reprezinte?" is a direct electoral call to action, combined with "USR, o voce pentru Caraș-Severin!" shows clear electoral intent.

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather campaign messaging.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is official party communication (USR Caraș-Severin) with a CMF number.

Key factors:
- The post is clearly electoral propaganda for parliamentary elections
- It's paid advertising with significant reach
- Contains a CMF number
- Uses electoral messaging
- Is from an official party organization

However, this appears to be targeting parliamentary elections, not presidential elections, which makes it legal as the parliamentary campaign period is still ongoing.
