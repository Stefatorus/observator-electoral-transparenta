Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240060" which indicates this is electoral propaganda material

2. Refers to candidate: No direct reference to any presidential candidate, but refers to REPER party

3. Addresses wide population: Yes
- It's a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Significant reach (25,000-29,999 impressions)
- Uses general language "Votează" addressing a wide audience
- Substantial spend (100-199 RON)

4. Electoral objective: Yes
- Direct call to action "Votează REPER!"
- Clear intention to influence voting behavior

5. Journalism: No
- This is clearly a promotional message, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion: No
- This is an official party communication, not a personal view

The post is clearly electoral propaganda, published by the REPER party. However, since REPER is not participating in the presidential elections (not in the candidate list) and is only participating in the parliamentary elections which are still in the legal campaign period, this appears to be legal parliamentary election propaganda.

This is electoral propaganda for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. While it contains all elements of propaganda (CMF number, call to action, paid distribution), it targets only the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.
