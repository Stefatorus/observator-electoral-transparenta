While this post is critical of Marcel Ciolacu and PSD, it primarily focuses on a specific policy issue (Codul Silvic). The timing during the electoral period and the criticism of a presidential candidate could suggest propaganda, but the content is primarily issue-focused rather than election-focused. The post doesn't explicitly attempt to influence voting behavior, instead focusing on environmental policy consequences.

4. Functions more as issue advocacy than electoral propaganda
