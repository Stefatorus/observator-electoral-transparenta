Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Presence:
- Yes, contains "CMF: 11240014" which indicates this is electoral material

2. Candidate Reference:
- Directly mentions "George Simion", who is a presidential candidate
- Also mentions AUR multiple times
- However, the main focus appears to be on parliamentary elections, as indicated by #AURÎnParlament

3. Wide Population Addressing:
- Posted as a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Large reach (10,000-14,999 impressions)
- Clearly intended for mass communication

4. Electoral Objective:
- The message explicitly supports AUR and George Simion
- Uses political hashtags and campaign messaging
- However, appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary campaign, which is still allowed

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Contains direct political messaging and endorsement

6. Personal Opinion:
- While presented as a personal statement, it's a paid political advertisement
- The presence of CMF number confirms its campaign nature

The key point here is that while this mentions George Simion (a presidential candidate), the primary focus and context is clearly on parliamentary elections (#AURÎnParlament). Since parliamentary election campaigning is still allowed, this doesn't constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
