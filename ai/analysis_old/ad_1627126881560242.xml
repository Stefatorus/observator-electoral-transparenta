Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Reference to Candidate: Yes, the post directly refers to Mircea-Dan Geoană, who is a presidential candidate (position 6 on the ballot).

3. Addresses Wide Population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral Objective: Not directly. The content appears to be news reporting about a financial dispute between Geoană and an Israeli consultant. While it could potentially influence voters negatively, the primary purpose appears to be news reporting.

5. Journalism: The content appears to be journalistic in nature, reporting on a specific allegation or news event. It follows a typical news format and comes from a news outlet (PS News).

6. Personal Opinion: This doesn't appear to be a personal opinion piece but rather a news report about a specific situation.

The timing of this advertisement (November 22, 2024) is during the period when electoral propaganda for presidential elections is prohibited. However, the content appears to be primarily journalistic in nature, reporting on a specific news event rather than direct electoral propaganda.
