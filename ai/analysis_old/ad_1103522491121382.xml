Let's analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF: 11240017" which indicates this is electoral material
2. Candidate Reference: While the post mentions "#TĂTĂRANI", it doesn't directly name a presidential candidate
3. Wide Population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram targeting a population between 1001-5000 people
4. Electoral Objective: The message "CALEA SIGURĂ" (The Safe Way) suggests an electoral message
5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalism but a campaign message
6. Personal Opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication (from PSD Dâmbovița)

The post shows characteristics of electoral propaganda:
- It's a paid advertisement
- Uses official party channels (PSD Dâmbovița)
- Contains a CMF number
- Uses campaign messaging ("CALEA SIGURĂ")

However, this appears to be focused on local/parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections, as it mentions "TĂTĂRANI" (a commune in Dâmbovița county).

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be targeting local/parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and therefore allowed. The message doesn't specifically reference any presidential candidate or the presidential election.
