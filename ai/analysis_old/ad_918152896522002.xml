Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to ION-MARCEL CIOLACU, who is a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with an estimated reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes. The post appears to be trying to damage Ciolacu's image by highlighting his "aroganță" (arrogance) and suggesting improper use of private luxury jets paid by a bankrupt real estate company. The timing and nature of this expose suggests electoral motivation.

5. Journalism: While it cites G4Media as a source, the presentation and timing of this information, especially as a paid advertisement during the election period, suggests it goes beyond pure journalism.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather a promoted news story with clear negative implications for a candidate.

The post is clearly targeting Marcel Ciolacu with negative information during the electoral period, using paid promotion to reach a wide audience. The timing and method of delivery suggest this is electoral propaganda rather than purely journalistic content.
