Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, though this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" and promotes him as presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post addressing "Dragi cetățeni" and targeting a significant audience (1000-1999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, clear electoral objectives:
- Direct call to vote for Marcel Ciolacu as president
- Direct call to vote for PSD in parliamentary elections
- Promotes Adela Geamănu as PSD candidate for Chamber of Deputies

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj, structured as campaign material.

The post violates Article 55 t) because:
- It continues presidential electoral propaganda after the campaign period ended
- Makes direct appeals to vote for a presidential candidate
- Is a paid promotion running after the presidential campaign period
- Combines parliamentary election (still legal) with presidential election messaging (illegal at this point)
