Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, specifically mentions "George Simion" who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 - AUR). Also mentions Eugen Popescu as an AUR Senate candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, while it appears to be sharing information about Moldova interdiction, it's clearly meant to build a narrative around AUR candidates and their alleged opposition to pro-Russian leadership.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't follow journalistic standards. It's a direct quote from a candidate being promoted through paid advertising.

6. Personal opinion: While presented as a personal statement, it's being promoted through paid advertising during the election period.

The post appears to be electoral propaganda as it:
- Mentions both a presidential candidate (Simion) and senate candidate (Popescu)
- Is being actively promoted through paid advertising
- Has clear political messaging
- Targets a wide audience
- Links to a political website
