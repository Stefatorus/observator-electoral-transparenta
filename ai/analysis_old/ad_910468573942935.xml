Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF 11240017" is present at the end of the post
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Alexandra Crivineanu" as candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (70,000-80,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează PSD", "Votează Alexandra Crivineanu Deputat")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with CMF number

This post is exclusively targeting the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. While this post is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed, therefore this type of advertising is legal for that specific election.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda as it:
- Contains a CMF number
- Directly asks for votes
- Names a specific candidate
- Is a paid advertisement
- Has clear electoral objectives
However, as it targets only the parliamentary elections (not presidential), it is legal and allowed during this period.
