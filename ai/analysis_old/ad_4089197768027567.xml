While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it primarily targets the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as current government leader discussing economic policies, not as a presidential candidate. The focus is on PSD's parliamentary program and economic measures.
