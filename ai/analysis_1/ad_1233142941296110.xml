Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "11240015" appears at the end of the message
2. Refers to candidate: No specific presidential candidate is mentioned, but refers to position 2 on the ballot for parliamentary elections
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - it's a paid advertisement targeting 100,001-500,000 people across Facebook and Instagram
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential
5. Journalism: No - this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No - this is an organized campaign message from USR Teleorman

This is interesting because while it is electoral propaganda, it appears to be for the parliamentary elections ("Pe 1 decembrie") which are still in their legal campaign period. The post doesn't mention any presidential candidates or the presidential election.

Key observations:
- The message is clearly electoral in nature
- It targets parliamentary elections on December 1st, not presidential elections
- Has an official CMF number (11240015)
- Paid advertisement with significant reach
- Posted by USR Teleorman

This is electoral propaganda, but it's legal as it's for the parliamentary elections which are still in their campaign period. The post doesn't mention or influence the presidential election in any way. It focuses on local candidates for parliament from Teleorman versus "imposters from Bucharest."
