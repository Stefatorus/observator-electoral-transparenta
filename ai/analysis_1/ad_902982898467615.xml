Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present in the post, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to Candidate: The post explicitly mentions "George Simion", who is a presidential candidate (Poziția nr. 2 – GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION – Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor).

3. Addresses Wide Population:
- It's a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Has a significant reach (80,000-89,999 impressions)
- Substantial ad spend (600-699 RON)
- Targets a very large audience (1,000,001+ estimated audience)

4. Electoral Objective:
- The title "George Simion explică cum se cucerește un popor" (George Simion explains how to conquer a people) appears to be politically motivated
- Given the timing (during election period) and the focus on a presidential candidate, this has clear electoral implications

5. Journalism:
- This doesn't appear to be journalistic content
- The title suggests opinion or political messaging rather than news reporting

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but rather a sponsored, widely distributed political message

The timing of this post (November 22, 2024) and its continued running during the presidential election period, after the campaign period has ended, is particularly problematic.

<conclusion>

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- Directly features a presidential candidate
- Is a paid advertisement with wide reach
- Occurs after the campaign period ended
- Has clear political messaging
- Not journalistic in nature
- Substantial resources invested in distribution
