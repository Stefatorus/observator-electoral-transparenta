<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. <has-cmf>
No CMF number is present in this post, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as electoral propaganda.

2. <refers-to-candidate>
The post doesn't explicitly refer to any presidential candidate. Instead, it focuses on local PSD parliamentary candidates and their promises for Botoșești-Paia.

3. <addresses-the-wide-population>
Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting the population of Botoșești-Paia, clearly addressing the wide population of that area.

4. <electoral-objective>
Yes, this has a clear electoral objective for the parliamentary elections, as evidenced by the closing statement "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Botoșești-Paia!" and the list of projects that "parlamentarii PSD le vor susține."

5. <journalism>
This is not journalism - it's clearly a campaign promise list and electoral message.

6. <personal_opinion>
This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication with electoral promises.

The post is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's aimed at the parliamentary elections on December 1st, not the presidential elections. Therefore, this type of propaganda is currently legal and allowed.
</analysis>

<conclusion>
<post_id>1131761111710171</post_id>
<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is definitely electoral propaganda because it:
- Makes specific electoral promises
- Calls for votes explicitly
- Is paid advertising
- Comes from an official party page
However, it's legal propaganda as it targets the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections where the campaign period has ended.
