<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "Cod AEP: 11240002" at the end
2. Refers to candidate: This post primarily promotes Carmen Ivănescu as a PNL candidate for parliament, but also mentions Nicolae Ciucă, who is a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes for PNL lists on December 1st
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message

The post contains both parliamentary election content (which is allowed) and a reference to Nicolae Ciucă as PNL president. However, since the mention of Ciucă is incidental and in the context of his role as party president rather than as presidential candidate, and the main focus is clearly on the parliamentary campaign, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t).

Key aspects:
- The primary focus is parliamentary elections (still in legal campaign period)
- The mention of Ciucă is contextual, not promotional for presidential race
- The call to action is specifically for parliamentary elections on December 1st
- Contains proper electoral marking (AEP code)

This is electoral propaganda, but for parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Nicolae Ciucă is incidental and in his capacity as party president, not as presidential candidate.
