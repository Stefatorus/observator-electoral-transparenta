While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The content discusses party programs, future governance plans, and infrastructure projects, without mentioning presidential candidates or the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number confirms it's official campaign material, but for the allowed parliamentary campaign.
