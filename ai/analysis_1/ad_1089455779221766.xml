5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message

However, this is important: This advertisement is for the parliamentary elections (Camera Deputaților), not the presidential elections.

Therefore, while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it does NOT violate Article 55 t) as it's not related to the presidential elections.
