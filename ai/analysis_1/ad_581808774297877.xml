Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF 11240017, indicating this is electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- Mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate
- Also mentions former PSD prime ministers (Victor Ponta, Mihai Tudose)
- However, the context is historical and factual about infrastructure development

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- It's a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targets a significant audience (50,001-100,000 people)
- Focuses on Tulcea region but has broader implications

4. Electoral Objective:
- While promoting PSD's achievements, the focus is primarily on infrastructure development
- Presents historical facts about the BrÄƒila-Tulcea bridge project
- More informative about past achievements than direct electoral messaging

5. Journalistic Nature:
- Contains factual information about infrastructure development
- Presents a timeline of events with specific dates
- More informative than persuasive

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion piece but rather an institutional communication from PSD Tulcea

The post appears to be walking a fine line between information sharing and subtle political promotion, but its primary focus is on infrastructure achievements rather than direct electoral messaging for the presidential election.

While this post contains elements of political communication, it primarily focuses on infrastructure development and historical achievements. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in the context of his role as Prime Minister in relation to the bridge project, not specifically as a presidential candidate. However, given the timing and the presence of a CMF number, this could be considered indirect electoral propaganda.

While this post does promote PSD and mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does not explicitly violate Article 55 t) as it:
1. Focuses on factual infrastructure developments
2. Mentions Ciolacu in his capacity as Prime Minister rather than presidential candidate
3. Does not explicitly encourage voting behavior
4. Serves more as an informational piece about regional development
