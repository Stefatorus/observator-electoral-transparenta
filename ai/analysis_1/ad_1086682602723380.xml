Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly refers to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: While the post is critical of Ciolacu, it appears to be more of a journalistic piece criticizing his alleged false claims about a conversation with Trump. However, given the timing and the negative portrayal ("minciună de Pinocchio", "premier fără busolă"), it could be considered to have electoral implications.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be presenting information about a claimed event, the tone and language used ("minciună de Pinocchio", "premier fără busolă") goes beyond standard journalistic practice and enters into editorial commentary.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post but rather a published article from a media outlet.

The timing of this post (November 22, 2024) and its continued promotion after the end of the presidential campaign period makes it problematic under Article 55 t).
