Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "premierul Ciolacu" who is also ION-MARCEL CIOLACU, a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook post with significant reach (3,000-3,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While it mentions Ciolacu, the context is about his current role as Prime Minister and his industrial policy, not directly about the presidential campaign. However, the timing and positive framing during the electoral period could be seen as indirect propaganda.

5. Journalism: This appears to be presented as a news article about industrial policy and its effects, following a journalistic format.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather a news report.

The timing of this ad (November 22, 2024) falls within the period when presidential campaign propaganda is prohibited, and it presents the presidential candidate Ciolacu in a positive light through his actions as Prime Minister.

This case presents a grey area, but several factors point to it being electoral propaganda:
- Timing during the restricted period
- Positive presentation of a presidential candidate
- Paid promotion to reach wide audience
- Links current achievements to the candidate's leadership
Although presented as news, the paid promotion during the restricted period of content featuring a presidential candidate suggests propaganda intent.

PS News, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea platita a unui material ce prezinta in mod pozitiv realizarile candidatului prezidential Ion Marcel Ciolacu dupa incheierea campaniei electorale. Materialul, cu ID-ul postarii pe facebook 1786970205398033, a fost promovat dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, prezentand realizarile candidatului intr-un mod care poate influenta preferintele electorale, acest lucru constituind propaganda electorala in perioada restrictionata. Efectul electoral este evident prin asocierea pozitiva a candidatului cu succese in domeniul reindustrializarii, depasind sfera simplei informari jurnalistice prin promovarea platita si targetata.
