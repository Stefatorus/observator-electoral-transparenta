Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, CMF 11240002 is present, indicating this is electoral material

2. Candidate reference: This post does not directly reference any presidential candidates from our list. Instead, it promotes PNL as a party for parliamentary elections.

3. Wide population targeting: Yes, this is clearly addressing the wide population:
- It's a paid advertisement
- Targets 500,001-1,000,000 people
- High impression count (450,000-499,999)
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram
- Specifically targets Bacău region voters

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections:
- Direct call to action: "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează PNL!"
- Promotes PNL's team and projects
- Mentions specific election date (December 1st)

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content

6. Personal opinion: No, this is official party communication with CMF number

The key point here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically for the parliamentary elections happening on December 1st, not for the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

- Contains CMF number
- Clear call to vote
- Professional campaign material
- High reach and paid distribution
- However, it's exclusively focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential
