<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240050 is present at the end of the post.

2. Refers to candidates:
- Mentions Klaus Iohannis indirectly
- Mentions Ciucă and Ciolacu in context of government decisions
However, these references are mainly in the context of past actions, not direct electoral messaging for the presidential race.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post on Facebook targeting a large audience (estimated 1,000,001+ people).

4. Electoral objective: 
- The post focuses primarily on parliamentary elections and policy positions
- The author identifies himself as a parliamentary candidate ("candidat al PPR la Camera Deputaților")
- The messaging is primarily about military spending vs. healthcare policy
- The presidential election references are secondary and in context of broader policy criticism

5. Journalism: While it contains opinion and analysis, it goes beyond journalistic standards with clear political messaging and campaign rhetoric.

6. Personal opinion: While expressing strong personal views, this is clearly structured as a campaign message, complete with party messaging and CMF number.

The key point is that while this post is indeed electoral propaganda, it's focused on the parliamentary elections (which are still in their legal campaign period) rather than the presidential election.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but primarily for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mentions of presidential candidates are incidental and in the context of policy criticism rather than direct presidential campaign messaging.
