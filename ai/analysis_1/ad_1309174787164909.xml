<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, which might indicate this isn't traditional electoral propaganda, but not conclusive.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly mentions "Nicolae Ciucă", who is position nr. 4 on the presidential candidates list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with significant reach (7,000-7,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While subtle, this post appears to be promoting Nicolae Ciucă by highlighting his positive comments about Blaj, potentially aiming to influence voters by showing his appreciation for local development.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content as it's a selective quote promoting a specific candidate's view.

6. Personal opinion: This is a strategic promotion of a candidate's statement, not a personal opinion.

The timing is particularly relevant as this is being promoted after the conclusion of the presidential campaign period, making it problematic under Article 55 t).
