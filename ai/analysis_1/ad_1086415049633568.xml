Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Candidate Reference: This post does not directly refer to any presidential candidates. It focuses on local projects for Ghidici and mentions PSD parliamentarians in general.

3. Wide Population Targeting: 
- This is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad
- It targets residents of Ghidici
- It's posted by an official party page (PSD Dolj)
- It's clearly meant for public consumption

4. Electoral Objective:
- The post concludes with "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Ghidici!"
- It lists projects that PSD parliamentarians will support
- This is clearly related to the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- It presents party promises and calls for votes
- However, it's for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication

Important context: This is propaganda for the parliamentary elections (December 1st), not the presidential elections. The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's legal because:
1. It targets only the parliamentary elections
2. It doesn't mention presidential candidates
3. It's within the allowed campaign period for parliamentary elections
4. It focuses on local development projects and parliamentary representation
