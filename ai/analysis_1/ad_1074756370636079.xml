Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is visible in the post, but this isn't decisive.

2. Refers to candidate: The post refers to Virgiliu Gheorghe Vlăescu, who is a candidate for Senate, not for the presidential election. This is important because parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and a substantial budget (300-399 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, it has an electoral objective, but specifically for the Senate election, not the presidential election. The candidate clearly states "Candidez pe lista AUR în județul Suceava pe locul I la Senat."

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign advertisement, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a formal campaign announcement.

Key points:
- This is parliamentary election propaganda, which is still allowed
- Does not mention or influence presidential candidates
- Clear electoral message but for a different election
- Professional campaign material (paid advertising)

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda, but for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The timing and content are legal as parliamentary election campaigns are ongoing. The post promotes a Senate candidate for AUR and doesn't mention or influence the presidential election in any way.
