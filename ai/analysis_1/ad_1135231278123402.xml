This is electoral propaganda material, but it primarily focuses on the parliamentary elections (Senate candidate Sergiu Mihalcea). While it mentions Simion's "plan," it does so in the context of the parliamentary campaign. Since the parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing, this type of propaganda is still permitted.
