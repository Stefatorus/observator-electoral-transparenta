Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- No CMF number is visible in the post, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- The post is from Mihai-Viorel Putz, who identifies himself as an AUR Senate candidate
- References George Simion indirectly through "Planul Simion"

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid Facebook advertisement
- Has reached between 50,000-59,999 impressions
- Targets a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people
- Clearly addresses a wide audience ("Cu ajutorul vostru")

4. Electoral Objective:
- This is clearly campaign material for the parliamentary elections
- Presents the candidate's credentials and vision
- Seeks support for his Senate candidacy

5. Journalism vs. Propaganda:
- This is clearly a campaign message, not journalism
- Presents a political platform and seeks electoral support

6. Personal Opinion:
- While personal background is shared, it's structured as a campaign message
- The message is crafted for political campaign purposes

Since this advertisement is specifically for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period, and not for the presidential elections, it does not violate Article 55 t).
