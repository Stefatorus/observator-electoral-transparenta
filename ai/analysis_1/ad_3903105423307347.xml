While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on parliamentary/local elections rather than presidential elections. The content is generic and does not specifically reference the presidential race or candidates. The presence of a CMF number confirms it's official campaign material, but the timing and content suggest it's part of the ongoing parliamentary campaign period, which is still allowed.
