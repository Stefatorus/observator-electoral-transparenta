<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with potential reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes. The post appears to be designed to damage Ciolacu's image by:
- Highlighting alleged "aroganță" (arrogance)
- Suggesting impropriety with private flights
- Implying hypocrisy regarding "family values"
- Creating controversy about his relationship with Elena Cocuz

5. Journalism: While presented as news, the tone and framing suggest this goes beyond objective journalism into attack-style political content.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a paid, targeted message.

The timing (November 22, during the electoral period) and the nature of the content strongly suggest this is electoral propaganda meant to influence voters against Ciolacu.
