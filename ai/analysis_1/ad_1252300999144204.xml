Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240017" is present at the end of the post
2. Refers to candidate: Yes - Mentions "Răzvan Popa" specifically as Senate candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - It's a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (80,000-90,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes - Direct call to action "Votează PSD" and "Votează Răzvan Popa Senator!"
5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content
6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with CMF number

This appears to be a parliamentary election advertisement, which is currently allowed as the parliamentary election campaign period is ongoing. The post is specifically promoting:
- PSD as a party
- Răzvan Popa as a Senate candidate

This does NOT appear to be related to the presidential election, which would be prohibited at this time.
