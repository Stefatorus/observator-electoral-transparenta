Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, it contains "Cod AEP CM11240022"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, identifies George Ionescu as a candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with significant reach (200,000-250,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, it's clearly identifying himself as a candidate for Deputy
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is official campaign communication

This appears to be a legitimate parliamentary election advertisement. The key points:
- It's explicitly for parliamentary elections (Deputy position)
- Contains proper AEP code
- The campaign for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- Does not mention or relate to presidential elections
- Does not attempt to influence presidential election voting

The spend (1500-1999 RON) and reach (200,000-250,000 impressions) indicate this is a significant campaign advertisement, but it's for the parliamentary elections which is currently allowed.
