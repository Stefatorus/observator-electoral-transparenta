Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Presence:
- Yes, contains "CMF: 11240015" which indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- This post lists multiple candidates for parliamentary elections
- Does not reference any presidential candidates
- This is specifically for parliamentary elections which are still in the allowed campaign period

3. Wide Population Address:
- Yes, it's a paid Facebook advertisement
- Targets a large estimated audience (100,001-500,000)
- Uses hashtags to increase visibility

4. Electoral Objective:
- Clear electoral objective for parliamentary elections
- Presents USR candidates for both Chamber of Deputies and Senate
- Uses campaign-specific language ("votultauconteaza")

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Presents party candidates and campaign messaging

6. Personal Opinion:
- Not a personal opinion but an official party communication

The key point here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. This is not related to the presidential elections where the campaign period has ended.
