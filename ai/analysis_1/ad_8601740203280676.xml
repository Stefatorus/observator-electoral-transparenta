- Also mentions Marcel Ciolacu, but in context of being Prime Minister
- Focus is primarily on parliamentary candidate Silviu Macovei

3. Addresses wide population:

- Uses public messaging format

4. Electoral objective:
- Clear electoral messaging for parliamentary elections
- Highlights candidate's achievements and promises
