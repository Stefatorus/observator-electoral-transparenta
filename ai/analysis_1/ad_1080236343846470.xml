This appears to be metadata for a Facebook/Instagram advertisement without the actual content visible, which makes it challenging to fully analyze the specifics of the message. However, I'll analyze the available information:

Without access to the actual content of the advertisement, it's impossible to determine if this constitutes electoral propaganda. While the timing and reach suggest potential electoral content, we cannot make a determination without seeing the actual message.

Note: To make a proper determination about whether this post violates Article 55 t), we would need:
1. The actual content of the advertisement
2. Information about what message was being promoted
3. Whether it references any presidential candidates
4. The nature of the content (whether it constitutes electoral propaganda)
