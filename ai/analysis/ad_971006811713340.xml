<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number Present: Yes (CMF 11240014) - This indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to Candidate: Indirectly mentions "Planul Simion" and AUR, referring to George Simion
3. Addresses Wide Population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral Objective: Yes, presents AUR's political platform and promises for parliamentary reform
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material promoting AUR's agenda
6. Personal Opinion: No, this is an official party communication with CMF number

The post discusses parliamentary reforms and government structure, which are relevant to both presidential and parliamentary campaigns. However, the reference to "Planul Simion" and the timing of the post make it problematic in the context of presidential elections.

However, since this post primarily focuses on parliamentary reforms and AUR's legislative agenda rather than explicitly promoting Simion's presidential candidacy, it operates in a grey area.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it primarily focuses on parliamentary reforms and party platform rather than direct presidential campaigning. The mention of "Planul Simion" is indirect and could be interpreted as part of the broader party agenda rather than specific presidential campaigning.

</conclusion>

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary election matters, which are still allowed during this period. The reference to "Planul Simion" is not explicit enough to constitute clear presidential campaign messaging. Therefore, this does not appear to violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004.
