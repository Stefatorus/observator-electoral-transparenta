<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: While the post mentions "candidates" generically, it doesn't specifically name or identify any particular presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post on Facebook/Instagram with significant reach (45,000-50,000 impressions) and a substantial ad spend (300-399 RON).

4. Electoral objective: No clear electoral objective is present. The post appears to be an analytical/informative piece about how candidates were perceived during the campaign period, presented as a retrospective analysis.

5. Journalism: This appears to be more aligned with data journalism or analytics, providing analysis of public perception and communication effectiveness during the campaign period.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather presents itself as a data-driven analysis.

Key considerations:
- The post is analytical in nature, discussing campaign dynamics retrospectively
- It doesn't promote or discourage voting for any specific candidate
- The content appears to be informative rather than persuasive
- The timing (November 23) is sensitive, but the content doesn't appear to be attempting to influence votes
