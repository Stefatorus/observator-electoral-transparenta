Let me analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF 11240017, indicating this is electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- Mentions "Ștefan Alecu" as candidate for Senator
- However, this is for parliamentary elections, not presidential

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement with significant reach (90,000-99,999 impressions)
- Targeted at a wide audience in Brașov
- Spent between 1000-1499 RON

4. Electoral Objective:
- Clear call to vote ("Votează")
- Specifically for parliamentary elections on December 1st
- Not related to presidential elections

5. Other Considerations:
- This is clearly campaign material for parliamentary elections
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- Does not mention or influence presidential elections
