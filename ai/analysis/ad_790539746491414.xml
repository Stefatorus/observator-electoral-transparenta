Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral material
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Ștefan Alecu" as Senate candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (90,000-99,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("votează PSD", "Votează Ștefan Alecu Senator!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with CMF number

However, this advertisement appears to be for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed, while only presidential election propaganda is prohibited at this time.

Key points:
- The ad promotes a Senate candidate (Parliamentary elections)
- Does not mention or relate to any presidential candidates
- Is within the legal campaign period for parliamentary elections

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is LEGAL propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period. The post promotes a Senate candidate and the PSD party for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st. It does not contain any content related to the presidential elections or candidates.
