Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF: 11240015" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not directly mention any presidential candidate from our list. However, it clearly promotes USR's governmental program.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with an estimated reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: The post focuses on healthcare policy proposals and is tagged with "#Alegeri1Decembrie" and "#USR2024", but appears to be targeting parliamentary elections rather than presidential ones.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a campaign message presenting policy proposals, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with a CMF number.

Key considerations:
- The post promotes USR's healthcare platform for governance
- Uses campaign hashtags and CMF number
- Focuses on future governmental policies
- Does not mention presidential race or candidates
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post constitutes electoral propaganda for parliamentary elections, but not for presidential elections. While it contains campaign elements (CMF number, policy proposals, party promotion), it focuses entirely on healthcare policy and parliamentary governance. The timing and content suggest this is aimed at the parliamentary campaign, which is still in its legal period. It doesn't attempt to influence the presidential vote or mention any presidential candidates.
