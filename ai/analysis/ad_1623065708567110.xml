Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to Elena Lasconi, who is a presidential candidate, by criticizing her foreign policy stance and competence.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of over 1 million people, with actual impressions between 25,000-30,000.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears designed to influence voters by portraying Lasconi as incompetent in foreign policy matters, using a quote from Cristoiu (a well-known journalist) to mock her approach to international relations.

5. Journalism: While it quotes a journalist (Cristoiu), the way it's presented as a paid advertisement with a clear negative focus on a single candidate suggests this isn't standard journalism but rather electoral messaging.

6. Personal opinion: This goes beyond personal opinion as it's a paid advertisement specifically targeting a presidential candidate during the electoral period.

The timing (November 23) and the fact that it's still running after the propaganda period for presidential elections has ended makes this particularly problematic.
