Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, it contains "CMF: 11240017"

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, refers to "Liviu-Bogdan Ciucă" who is a candidate for Chamber of Deputies, not for presidential elections

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad targeting 100,001-500,000 people, specifically targeting Galați residents

4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes with "#Votează Liviu-Bogdan Ciucă pentru Camera Deputaţilor!"

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalism

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message with official party backing (PSD) and professional media production (PAF MEDIA SRL)

However, this is important: This advertisement is for the parliamentary elections (Camera Deputaților), not for the presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed.

3. It contains all required legal markings (CMF number, commander, producer)
4. It's properly marked as political advertising
