While this is clearly political propaganda, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, discussing policy positions, rather than promoting his presidential candidacy. The post is about future parliamentary candidates and their stance on drug policy, not about the presidential race.
