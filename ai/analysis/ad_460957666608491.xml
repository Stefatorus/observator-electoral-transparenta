<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: The post includes financial mandate information (CUI mandatar financiar coordonator: 11240060), which is a requirement for electoral advertising.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions specific candidates (Andrei Popescu for Senate and Flavia Ghencea for Chamber of Deputies), but importantly, these are for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.

5. Journalism: This appears to be a structured electoral debate program, which combines both journalistic and electoral elements.

6. Personal opinion: Not applicable as this is a formal electoral debate announcement.

This is clearly electoral content, but it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and legal. This type of content is explicitly allowed during this period for parliamentary candidates.
