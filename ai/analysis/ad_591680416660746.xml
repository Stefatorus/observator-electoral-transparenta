1. Has CMF: Yes - CMF 11240022 is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes - Mentions Alexandru Kocsis-Cristea and promotes Forța Dreptei as a party. This is for parliamentary elections, which are still in the allowed propaganda period.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with a significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and targets a broad audience in Dolj area.

4. Electoral objective: Yes - The post explicitly calls for votes ("Pe 1 decembrie, votați cu încredere Forța Dreptei!") and promotes their political agenda and candidates.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content. It presents party positions and calls for votes.
