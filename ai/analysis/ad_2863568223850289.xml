While this is a promoted post from PSD, it appears to be government communication rather than electoral propaganda. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate. The content focuses on current government policies and economic strategies, without any direct connection to the presidential campaign. The absence of a CMF number and campaign-specific messaging further supports this interpretation.
