<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it mentions Mircea-Dan Geoană, who is a presidential candidate (position 6)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post by a news outlet reaching potentially 1000-1999 people

4. Electoral objective: This appears to be more journalistic in nature, reporting on a debt claim against Geoană by an Israeli consultant. While it could potentially impact his image negatively, the primary purpose appears to be news reporting rather than electoral propaganda

5. Journalism: The content appears to be primarily journalistic, reporting on a news story about a financial dispute. This falls under normal journalistic activity as defined in Article 36(7)(d)

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather a news report

The post appears to be a legitimate news story about a financial dispute involving a presidential candidate. While it mentions a candidate, it:
- Focuses on reporting a specific news event
- Does not contain explicit electoral messaging
- Falls within normal journalistic activity
- Does not advise how to vote
- Is presented as news rather than campaign material
