<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240060"
2. Refers to candidate: No specific presidential candidate is mentioned, but refers to REPER party
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (25,000-29,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly calls for voting ("VoteazÄƒ REPER!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that this appears to be for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. REPER is not running a presidential candidate, and this appears to be general party propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.

While this is definitely electoral propaganda (presence of CMF, direct call to vote, paid distribution), it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The message is general party promotion for REPER, which is not running a presidential candidate. Since parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed, this type of propaganda is legal.
