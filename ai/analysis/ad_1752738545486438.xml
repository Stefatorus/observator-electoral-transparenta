This is electoral propaganda, but primarily focused on parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The post discusses economic policies and criticizes current government parties, but doesn't explicitly campaign for the presidential election. While Ludovic Orban is mentioned, it's in reference to his past governmental achievements rather than his presidential candidacy.
