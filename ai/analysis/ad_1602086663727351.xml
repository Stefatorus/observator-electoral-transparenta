Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly refers to "Lasconi" who is Elena-Valerica Lasconi, a presidential candidate (Position #1).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people, targeting a broad audience.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post specifically talks about "losing votes" ("pierde voturi"), which directly relates to electoral outcomes. The message appears designed to influence public opinion about a presidential candidate during the voting period.

5. Journalism: While presented on a news-like platform (5news.RO), the headline appears more as a statement of opinion rather than objective journalism. It lacks the balanced approach and informative nature expected of journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: This does not appear to be a personal opinion but rather a sponsored message intended to reach a wide audience with a specific narrative about a candidate's electoral performance.

The timing of this post (November 23, 2024) is particularly significant as it's during the electoral silence period for the presidential elections.
