<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is electoral propaganda, but it's focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Ludovic Orban is incidental and historical, not promotional for his presidential candidacy. The main focus is on parliamentary candidates and party policies.
