While this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Ludovic Orban is incidental and historical, not promoting him as a presidential candidate. The post focuses on tax policies and parliamentary candidates for Neamț county.

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it is legitimate campaign material for the ongoing parliamentary election campaign, not presidential election propaganda. The mention of Ludovic Orban is in a historical context, not as a presidential candidate, and the clear focus is on parliamentary candidates and their policy positions.
