Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Present (CMF 11240015) - This indicates it's political propaganda
2. References to candidates: No direct reference to presidential candidates
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, through paid Facebook/Instagram advertising
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("vocea ta în Parlamentul României")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

Key observations:
- The post is about parliamentary representation ("Parlamentul României")
- Contains a clear call to action for parliamentary elections
- Uses emotional appeal ("luptăm pentru tine")
- Has significant reach (15,000-19,999 impressions)
- Includes official CMF number
- Doesn't mention presidential elections or candidates

The important distinction here is that while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's specifically targeting parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.
