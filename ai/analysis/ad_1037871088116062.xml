<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF (CMF: 11240017) - Yes, clearly marked twice
2. Refers to candidate - Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu directly
3. Addresses wide population - Yes, it's a paid post reaching 40,000-45,000 impressions
4. Electoral objective - This is complex:
   - The post primarily focuses on Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister and candidate for Chamber of Deputies
   - Makes no reference to presidential elections
   - Discusses infrastructure projects and local development
   - Uses hashtags related to BuzÄƒu and general development
5. Journalism - No, this is clearly a promotional post
6. Personal opinion - No, this is an official party communication

The post appears to be focused on parliamentary elections and Ciolacu's current role as Prime Minister, not on the presidential election. While Ciolacu is indeed a presidential candidate, this specific content promotes his parliamentary candidacy and prime ministerial achievements, which is still allowed during this period.

</conclusion>

The post does not violate Article 55 t) as it focuses on parliamentary elections (which are still in the allowed campaign period) and Ciolacu's current role as Prime Minister, rather than the presidential campaign. The content is legitimate political communication for ongoing electoral activities.
