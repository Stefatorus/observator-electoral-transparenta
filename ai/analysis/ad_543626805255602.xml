Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3). However, the context is important - he's mentioned as "president" in relation to a country plan, not specifically for the presidential campaign.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad targeting a large audience (estimated 1M+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: The post primarily focuses on parliamentary elections and local development, not the presidential race. The mention of Ciolacu is in his current role as leader/president, not as a presidential candidate.

5. Journalism: This is clearly campaign material, not journalism.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official party communication, not a personal opinion.

Key considerations:
- The post is primarily about parliamentary elections, which are still in the legal campaign period
- Ciolacu is mentioned in his current official capacity, not as a presidential candidate
- The focus is on local development and parliamentary candidates
- The messaging doesn't encourage voting for Ciolacu in the presidential election

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in context of his current role and his party's development plan, not his presidential candidacy. The post discusses local development issues and parliamentary candidates without attempting to influence the presidential vote.
