Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Contains CMF 11240017, indicating it's electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- Mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate
- However, the main focus is on parliamentary elections and local PSD candidates

3. Wide Population Address:
- Clearly addresses the wide population
- Paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Large estimated audience size (>1 million)

4. Electoral Objective:
- Primary focus is on parliamentary elections (which is still in allowed campaign period)
- Secondary mention of Ciolacu's "country plan" ties it to presidential elections
- Presents development plans and promises

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Presents party promises and campaign meetings
- Has official CMF number

6. Personal Opinion:

The post primarily focuses on parliamentary elections (which is allowed) but includes a reference to presidential candidate Marcel Ciolacu and his "country plan", which could be considered presidential campaign content during the prohibited period.

This is a mixed case where the primary content is legitimate parliamentary campaign material, but it includes elements of presidential campaign by referencing Marcel Ciolacu's "country plan" during the presidential campaign blackout period. While subtle, this reference could be interpreted as continuing presidential electoral propaganda after its conclusion.

PSD Iași, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material electoral (ID Facebook: 543626805255602) ce face referire la "planul de țară al președintelui Marcel Ciolacu" după ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, în perioada de restricție electorală pentru alegerile prezidențiale. Deși postarea se concentrează aparent pe alegerile parlamentare, includerea referinței la planul prezidențial al candidatului Marcel Ciolacu reprezintă o continuare a propagandei electorale prezidențiale după încheierea acesteia, cu un impact estimat între 15.000 și 19.999 de afișări.
