Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't decisive by itself.

2. Refers to candidates: Yes, explicitly mentions multiple presidential candidates:
- ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI
- NICOLAE-IONEL CIUCĂ
- MIRCEA-DAN GEOANĂ

3. Addresses wide population: Yes
- It's a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Has reached 35,000-40,000 impressions
- Targets a very large potential audience (over 1 million)

4. Electoral objective: Yes
- Directly attacks and diminishes candidates' perceived competence
- Creates a negative narrative about specific candidates
- Uses comparative language to rank candidates ("medalia de bronz")
- The timing (during election period) is significant

5. Journalism: No
- This is not presenting objective news
- It's presenting an opinion meant to influence voters
- Lacks journalistic balance or factual reporting

6. Personal opinion: While it quotes Crin Antonescu, this is being amplified through paid advertising, making it part of a campaign rather than mere personal expression.

This post appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It targets specific presidential candidates
- Uses negative messaging to influence voter perception
- Is being actively promoted through paid channels
- Timing coincides with election period
- Reaches a mass audience
- Goes beyond journalistic reporting

60m.RO, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin publicarea si promovarea unei reclame platite pe Facebook si Instagram (ID: 3735627486698840) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, care constituie propaganda electorala explicita impotriva candidatilor Elena Lasconi, Nicolae Ciuca si Mircea Geoana. Postarea utilizeaza un mesaj denigrator ("cea mai slabă dintre cei slabi") si face o comparatie defaimatoare intre candidati ("se lupta pentru medalia de bronz"), avand un evident scop electoral de influentare negativa a intentiei de vot. Materialul a fost distribuit ca reclama platita catre un public de peste 35.000 de persoane, demonstrand intentia clara de a influenta rezultatul alegerilor prezidentiale prin continuarea propagandei electorale dupa incheierea perioadei legale.
