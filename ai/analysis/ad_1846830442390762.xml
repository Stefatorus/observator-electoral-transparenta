<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF (CMF 11240017) - Yes, this indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate - Yes, mentions "Lucian Patrașcu" for Senator position
3. Addresses wide population - Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (175,000-199,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective - Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("votează PSD", "Votează Lucian Patrașcu Senator!")
5. Journalism - No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion - No, this is an official party communication

However, this appears to be for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. Therefore, while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it's not related to the presidential elections where the propaganda period has ended.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda as evidenced by:
- Contains CMF number
- Direct call to vote ("votează")
- Names specific candidate
- Paid advertisement with wide reach
- Official party communication

However, it's for parliamentary elections (Senator position) which is still in the allowed campaign period.
