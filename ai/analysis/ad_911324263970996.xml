<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to Nicolae Ciucă, who is position nr. 4 on the presidential candidates list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: While the content references a statement by Ciucă about "șmecheria", it appears to be sharing news content rather than direct electoral messaging.

5. Journalism: This appears to be a news article shared by PS News, a news platform. The format and presentation suggest journalistic content rather than direct campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: Not applicable as this is presented as news content.

Key considerations:
- The post is promoting a news article about a candidate's statement
- It's being promoted after the conclusion of the presidential campaign period
- However, it appears to be primarily journalistic in nature
- The content doesn't explicitly call for voting or not voting for the candidate
</analysis>
