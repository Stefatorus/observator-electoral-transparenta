Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 - PSD).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with significant reach (30,000-35,000 impressions) and substantial spend (900-999 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post clearly has electoral objectives:
- Presents Ciolacu in a very positive light
- Explicitly mentions his candidacy for president
- Makes claims about his capabilities as a future president
- Suggests he would be the best president who "understands Romanians and their needs"

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's a personal endorsement with clear political messaging.

6. Personal opinion: While framed as a personal opinion, the scale, paid nature, and timing of the message indicate this is coordinated campaign messaging.

Key problematic elements:
- Promotes Ciolacu's presidential candidacy during the restricted period
- Makes direct claims about his suitability as president
- Uses his current position as PM to promote his presidential candidacy
- Significant paid reach during the restricted period

Dancus Ioan Doru, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui mesaj de propaganda electorala pentru candidatul ION-MARCEL CIOLACU dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie electorala, prin intermediul unei postari sponsorizate pe Facebook (ID: 1107137107522452) dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Postarea promoveaza explicit candidatura la presedintie a lui Marcel Ciolacu, il prezinta ca fiind cel mai potrivit candidat pentru functia de presedinte ("este președintele care înțelege românii și nevoile lor"), foloseste pozitia sa actuala de prim-ministru pentru a-i creste sansele electorale, si incearca sa influenteze alegatorii prin cheltuirea a 900-999 RON pentru o audienta estimata intre 30.000-35.000 de persoane. Mesajul are un evident caracter de propaganda electorala, depasind limitele unei simple opinii personale prin natura sa platita si distributia la scara larga.
