This is definitely electoral propaganda, but it's legal as it's for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. It contains all elements of propaganda:
- Official CMF number
- Campaign messaging
- Paid distribution
- Clear political objectives
However, it doesn't violate Article 55 t) as it doesn't relate to the presidential election or attempt to influence voting at polling stations.
