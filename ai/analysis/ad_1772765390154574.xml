4. Electoral objective: No clear electoral objective is present. The post appears to be informational in nature, asking if people know who the candidates are and promising to provide factual information about their achievements and relationships with Moldova.

5. Journalism: This appears to be journalistic/educational content. It's created by CPR Moldova (Center for Policy and Reform), which is presenting research about the candidates. The post mentions "research conducted by Alex Damian, associate expert of CPR Moldova."

Its primary purpose seems to be informing Moldovan citizens about the Romanian electoral process and candidates, which is legitimate journalistic and educational activity.
