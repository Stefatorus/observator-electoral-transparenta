Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post, but that's not definitive.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Planul Simion" and Mihail Neamțu. George-Nicolae Simion is a presidential candidate, but this post appears to be about parliamentary elections and Mihail Neamțu as a parliamentary candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting Bihor region.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections ("candidat AUR Bihor la Camera Deputaților"), not presidential.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication.

Important context:
- The post is primarily focused on parliamentary elections
- While Simion is mentioned, it's in context of a plan for Bihor, not his presidential candidacy
- The call to vote is explicitly for Mihail Neamțu as a parliamentary candidate

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post represents electoral propaganda, but specifically for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions Simion's name, it does so in the context of a regional development plan and focuses on promoting a parliamentary candidate. The primary electoral message is directed at supporting Mihail Neamțu for the Chamber of Deputies, not the presidential election.

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it is primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Simion is incidental and not in the context of the presidential election.
