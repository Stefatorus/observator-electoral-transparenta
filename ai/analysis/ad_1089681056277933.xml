While this post has political elements and is clearly from a political source (PSD), it appears to be more focused on communicating policy changes rather than direct electoral propaganda. The content is primarily informative about pension reforms and their implementation, presented in a factual manner. Although it could indirectly benefit the current government's image, it doesn't explicitly call for votes or mention the presidential election.
