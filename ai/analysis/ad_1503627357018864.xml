This is clearly electoral propaganda because:
- Has official CMF number
- Direct call to vote
- Paid distribution
- Party official channel
- Electoral promises and platform
However, this is LEGAL propaganda as it's for parliamentary elections, which are still in campaign period. The only concerning element is the mention of Elena Lasconi as president, but this is incidental and not the main focus of the ad.
