Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "George Simion" who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people) in Timișoara.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, clearly presents an electoral objective by explicitly asking people to:
- Vote for AUR in Parliamentary elections
- Vote for George Simion for president

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's a direct call to vote for specific candidates/party.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a paid advertisement with clear electoral objectives.

This post clearly violates Article 55 t) as it continues electoral propaganda for the presidential elections after the conclusion of the campaign period. It's particularly problematic because:
- It explicitly asks for votes for a presidential candidate
- It's a paid advertisement still running after the campaign period
- It reaches a significant audience (4,000-4,999 impressions)
</analysis>

This is clearly electoral propaganda because:
- Direct call to vote for specific candidate and party
- Paid advertisement reaching large audience
- Makes campaign promises (olympic rowing base)
- Combines parliamentary and presidential campaign messaging

UNIWORLD - MEDIA SRL, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unei reclame platite pe Facebook (ID: 1074079691186801) care face propaganda electorala explicita pentru candidatul prezidential George Simion dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie. Postarea contine un indemn direct la vot ("Votați [...] pe George Simion președinte"), fiind difuzata dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, atingand intre 4000-4999 de persoane. Materialul promite in mod explicit constructia unei baze olimpice de canotaj in schimbul votului, ceea ce confirma caracterul sau de propaganda electorala conform Art. 36(7) din Legea 334/2006.
