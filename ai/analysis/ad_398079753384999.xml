Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 - PSD). However, the context is important here - he is mentioned in his capacity as party leader and current Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement on Instagram reaching thousands of people.

4. Electoral objective: This is more complex. The post is focused on environmental policy and specifically the Forestry Code (Codul Silvic). While it criticizes Ciolacu and PSD, it does so in the context of their current governmental actions, not their presidential campaign.

5. Journalism/Activism: This appears to be issue-based activism from Declic, a known civic organization that regularly campaigns on environmental issues. The content is focused on a specific policy issue (Forestry Code) and its implications.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but rather an organizational stance on a specific policy issue.

The key aspects that suggest this is NOT electoral propaganda:
- Focus on current policy issues rather than electoral promises
- Criticism is directed at current governmental actions
- The timing and context relate to ongoing legislative processes
- The content is consistent with Declic's regular environmental activism
