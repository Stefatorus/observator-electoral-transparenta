<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No clear CMF number is visible in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it mentions "Planul Simion" and promotes Eugen Popescu for Senate. While George Simion is a presidential candidate, this post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections and Eugen Popescu's Senate candidacy.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections ("primul pe lista Senatului, Teleorman"). The reference to "Planul Simion" is ambiguous but appears to be referring to AUR's parliamentary program rather than the presidential campaign.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication.

The post is primarily focused on promoting a Senate candidate (Eugen Popescu) and while it mentions "Planul Simion," it appears to be in the context of parliamentary rather than presidential elections.

This case presents a complex situation where the content primarily promotes a parliamentary candidate but makes reference to a presidential candidate's "plan." However, since:
1. The main focus is clearly on parliamentary elections
2. The reference to Simion is in context of party policy rather than presidential candidacy
3. Parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed at this time
4. The call to action is specifically for voting for the Senate candidate

This appears to be legitimate parliamentary campaign material rather than presidential election propaganda.
