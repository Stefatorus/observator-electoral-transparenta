<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate:
- Mentions "Planul Simion" (referring to George Simion, presidential candidate)
- Promotes Eugen Popescu for Senate elections

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement
- Uses hashtags indicating broad reach (#VoteazăAUR #AURTeleorman)
- High estimated audience size (>1M potential reach)

4. Electoral objective:
- Clear call to vote ("Votează")
- Promotes party platform ("Planul Simion")
- Direct candidate promotion (Eugen Popescu)

5. Journalism: No journalistic content, purely promotional.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but an organized campaign message.

Important distinction: While this mentions Simion's plan, it's primarily focused on the parliamentary elections (promoting Eugen Popescu for Senate) which are still in the allowed campaign period, rather than the presidential election which has ended its campaign period.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it primarily targets the parliamentary elections (promoting Eugen Popescu for Senate) which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of "Planul Simion" is indirect and appears as part of the party's broader platform rather than direct presidential campaigning.

</conclusion>

Although this is electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It primarily promotes a parliamentary candidate during the legal campaign period
2. The reference to "Planul Simion" is indirect and part of the party platform
3. It doesn't specifically promote Simion as a presidential candidate
4. It doesn't advise voters at polling stations

Therefore, while this is electoral content, it falls within the legal boundaries of parliamentary election campaigning.
