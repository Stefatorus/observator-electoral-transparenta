This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's for the Senate elections (parliamentary) which is still in its legal campaign period. While it contains negative messaging about opponents and promotes a USR candidate, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it doesn't relate to the presidential elections where the propaganda period has ended.
