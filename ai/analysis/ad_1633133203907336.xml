<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is LEGAL propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period. The post focuses entirely on the Senate race in Ilfov and does not attempt to influence the presidential election. The mention of Ciucă is in his capacity as PNL leader, not as presidential candidate.
