Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: YES - Contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes - Mentions "Lucian Mija" as candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population: Yes - It's a paid advertisement reaching 200,000-250,000 impressions
4. Electoral objective: Yes - Directly calls for votes ("votează PSD", "Votează Lucian Mija Deputat")
5. Journalism: No - This is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content
6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with campaign code

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but importantly, it's for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The post promotes:
- PSD as a party
- Lucian Mija as parliamentary candidate
- Targets the December 1st parliamentary elections

This does NOT violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It's focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential
2. The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still active
3. It doesn't attempt to influence voting at polling stations
