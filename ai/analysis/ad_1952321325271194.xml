<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: While it mentions PNL (National Liberal Party), which has Nicolae CiucÄƒ as their presidential candidate, it doesn't directly name him. It's an article discussing PNL's campaign mobilization.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook, intended to reach a wide audience.

4. Electoral objective: The content appears to be more analytical/journalistic in nature, discussing party mobilization rather than directly advocating for or against any candidate.

5. Journalism: This appears to be a news article from PS News, featuring analysis from Remus Pricopie about PNL's campaign mobilization. It seems to fall within normal journalistic activity.

6. Personal opinion: The content represents expert analysis rather than personal opinion meant to influence voters.

Key factors:
- The post is primarily journalistic in nature
- It discusses campaign dynamics rather than advocating for or against candidates
- It's presented as news analysis rather than electoral propaganda
- While it mentions PNL, it doesn't explicitly promote or discourage voting for their candidate
</analysis>

This appears to be legitimate journalistic content rather than electoral propaganda. While it discusses electoral topics, it does so from an analytical perspective without clear intent to influence voters. The content falls under normal press coverage of electoral events rather than propaganda.
