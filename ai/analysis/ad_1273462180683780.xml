Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly references George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot). Also references the presidential elections explicitly.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post on Facebook with significant reach (4000-4999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post appears designed to negatively influence opinions about George Simion by:
- Revealing a controversial recorded conversation
- Showing him in negotiations with PSD representatives
- Using terms like "Satan" and "Satanel" which could be controversial
- Suggesting inappropriate political dealings

5. Journalism: While it cites journalistic sources (Defapt.ro), the presentation and timing during the electoral period suggest this goes beyond mere journalistic reporting.

6. Personal opinion: This isn't presented as personal opinion but rather as a news expose with clear political implications.

Vocea Botosani, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material cu caracter electoral dupa incheierea perioadei de propaganda, respectiv dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Materialul publicitar platit pe Facebook (ID: 1273462180683780) prezinta in mod explicit un candidat la alegerile prezidentiale (George Simion), intr-un context negativ, prin publicarea unei convorbiri controversate si utilizarea unui limbaj care poate influenta decizia alegatorilor. Continutul depaseste sfera jurnalistica obiectiva, avand un caracter vadit electoral prin modul de prezentare si contextul temporal al promovarii, cu intentia clara de a influenta negativ opinia publica fata de candidatul mentionat in perioada restrictionata legal.
