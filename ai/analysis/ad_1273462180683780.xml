This case requires careful analysis:

1. CMF Analysis: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference:
- Directly mentions George Simion, a presidential candidate
- References the ongoing presidential campaign explicitly
- Contains direct quotes and allegations about political dealings

3. Public Addressing:
- This is a paid advertisement reaching thousands of people (3000-3999 impressions)
- Posted on public platforms (Facebook and Instagram)
- Clearly intended for wide distribution

4. Electoral Objective:
- Released during the presidential campaign period
- Presents negative information about presidential candidate George Simion
- The timing and content suggest an intent to influence voters' opinions
- Shows alleged backdoor dealings between political figures

5. Journalistic Standards:
- While presenting investigative content, the tone and presentation go beyond objective journalism
- Uses emotional language and emphasis (‼️AUDIO BLAT PSD-AUR‼️)
- The presentation style suggests campaign messaging rather than neutral reporting

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not presented as a personal opinion but as a news expose
- It's a paid promotional post, indicating organized distribution
