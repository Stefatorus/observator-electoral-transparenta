Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is visible in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Echipa Valeriu Iftime" and discusses parliamentary elections, not presidential candidates.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a potentially large audience (100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this is clearly electoral content focused on the parliamentary elections ("peste 8 zile, pe 1 decembrie, trebuie să trimitem în Camera Deputaților și Senat oameni pe care ne putem baza").

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: While personal in tone, this is clearly a campaign message meant to influence voters.

Important context: This post is specifically about parliamentary elections (scheduled for December 1st) and not about the presidential election. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.
