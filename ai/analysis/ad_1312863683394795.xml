Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF presence: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Candidate reference: The post doesn't directly reference any presidential candidates from our list. However, it's clearly a political message from PSD Argeș.

3. Wide population targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting an estimated audience of 100,001-500,000 people, with significant spend (800-899 RON) and impressions (60,000-69,999).

4. Electoral objective: The content appears to be promoting PSD as a political force ("PSD este singura forță capabilă să aducă schimbările reale") but doesn't specifically relate to the presidential election or candidates.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content - it's a personal political statement and party promotion.

6. Personal opinion: While it contains personal views, it's clearly a structured political message with electoral purposes, but seems focused on parliamentary rather than presidential elections.

The post appears to be legitimate parliamentary election campaign material, as that campaign period is still ongoing. It doesn't violate Article 55 t) as it:
- Doesn't continue presidential election propaganda
- Doesn't attempt to influence voters at polling stations
- Is focused on parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period
