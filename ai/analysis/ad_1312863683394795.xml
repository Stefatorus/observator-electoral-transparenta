While this is clearly political content and electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections and general party messaging rather than the presidential election. The content discusses broad political themes and party values without referencing the presidential race or candidates. The presence of a CMF number confirms its nature as electoral propaganda, but it falls within the allowed category as it's not related to the presidential election whose campaign period has ended.
