While this post is clearly negative towards Marcel Ciolacu, it appears to be focused on his actions as Prime Minister rather than his presidential candidacy. The timing is sensitive, but the content itself discusses current diplomatic relations with Hungary and Ciolacu's role as PM. The absence of any reference to the presidential elections, voting, or his candidacy suggests this is more of a critical political commentary rather than electoral propaganda.
