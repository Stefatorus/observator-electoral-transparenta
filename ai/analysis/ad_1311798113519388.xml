Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF 11240015, indicating this is electoral propaganda

2. Reference to Candidates:
- No direct reference to presidential candidates
- Mentions "candida»õi la Parlamentare" clearly indicating this is for parliamentary elections

3. Addresses Wide Population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram
- Targets a large audience (500,001-1,000,000 potential reach)
- High spend (700-799 RON) and impressions (35,000-39,999)

4. Electoral Objective:
- While it has an electoral objective, it's specifically for parliamentary elections
- Criticizes current administration in Ilfov
- Focuses on local issues (infrastructure, schools, stray dogs)

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign communication, not journalism
- Uses comparative messaging ("vs") to highlight problems

6. Personal Opinion:
- While expressing opinions, it's clearly structured as campaign messaging
- Part of a coordinated campaign effort (mentions being with colleagues and candidates)

The key factor here is that while this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically targeted at the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. It makes no mention of presidential candidates or the presidential election.
