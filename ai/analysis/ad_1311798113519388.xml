Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Presence: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Candidate Reference: This post doesn't directly reference any presidential candidates from our list. However, it's clearly political content focused on parliamentary elections.

3. Wide Population Address: Yes, it addresses a wide audience:
- It's a paid advertisement
- Targets a large estimated audience (500,001-1,000,000)
- Has significant impressions (35,000-39,999)
- Published on multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram)

4. Electoral Objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential:
- Criticizes current local administration
- Presents a contrast between current problems and luxury
- Makes reference to "clanuri mafiote" in power
- Promotes USR's vision for Ilfov

5. Journalism vs Propaganda: This is clearly campaign material, not journalism, as evidenced by:
