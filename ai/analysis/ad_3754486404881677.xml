<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid post on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: This appears to be a mixed message:
- It talks about a meeting in Izvoarele about PSD's solutions for county development
- Mentions Schengen entry announcement
- Uses electoral hashtags like #ParlamentulRomâniei
- The mention of Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister making an announcement about Schengen

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign post with CMF number and party branding.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Teleorman).

Important context: While this does mention Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister announcing Romania's Schengen entry, not specifically in relation to the presidential campaign. The post appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections (note the hashtag #ParlamentulRomâniei) which are still in their legal campaign period.
