Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF:11240022 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Indirect reference. While Ludovic Orban is a presidential candidate and the leader of Forța Dreptei, the post doesn't directly mention him or the presidential race.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting Sibiu residents, specifically Liberal voters, with a significant reach (90,000-99,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: The message appears to be focused on party building and attracting Liberal voters to Forța Dreptei, rather than specifically about the presidential election.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political message.

6. Personal opinion: This appears to be a political statement about past work experience and an invitation to join the party.

Key considerations:
- The post focuses on local politics in Sibiu
- It's about party building rather than presidential elections
- No direct mention of the presidential race or candidate
- Contains CMF number but appears related to general party communication
