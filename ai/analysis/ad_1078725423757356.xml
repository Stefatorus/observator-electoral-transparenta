<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not specifically mention any presidential candidate by name or clear reference.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Instagram with a significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions) and substantial spend (600-699 RON).

4. Electoral objective: The message is very generic, stating "We need competent people in politics, with good intentions and work ethic." While this is a political statement, it's not specifically tied to the presidential elections or any particular candidate.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content, but rather an opinion statement.

6. Personal opinion: While this is an opinion, being a paid advertisement gives it a different context than a simple personal share.

However, the message is too generic to be considered electoral propaganda for the presidential elections. It could be interpreted as a general political statement or even related to other ongoing political processes (like parliamentary elections).
