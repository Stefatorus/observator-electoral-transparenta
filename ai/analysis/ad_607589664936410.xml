Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post doesn't directly name any presidential candidate from the provided list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting an estimated audience of 100,001-500,000 people in Bihor area.

4. Electoral objective: The message "Votează calea sigură pentru Bihor!" (Vote the safe path for Bihor!) is clearly an electoral message, but it's important to note that it appears to be focused on local/regional politics rather than the presidential election specifically.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content, but rather a clear campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a paid electoral message.

The key consideration here is whether this message constitutes presidential election propaganda after the campaign period. While it is clearly electoral in nature, it appears to be focused on regional politics (Bihor) rather than the presidential race. The message is generic enough that it could apply to any ongoing electoral campaign, including parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.

While this is clearly electoral content, several factors suggest this is not presidential election propaganda:
1. No mention of presidential candidates
2. Focus on local/regional (Bihor) politics
3. Generic message that could apply to other ongoing electoral campaigns
4. No specific reference to the presidential election
