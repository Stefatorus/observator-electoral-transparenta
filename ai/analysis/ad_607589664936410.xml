<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number in the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not explicitly mention any presidential candidate from the provided list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people, specifically in Bihor area.

4. Electoral objective: The message "Votează calea sigură pentru Bihor!" (Vote for the safe path for Bihor!) is clearly an electoral message, encouraging people to vote in a specific way.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content - it's a clear call to action for voting.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a paid electoral message.

The post appears to be focused on local/parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election, which would make it permissible under the current circumstances since parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda ("Votează calea sigură pentru Bihor!"), it appears to be targeting local/parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election. The message is generic and doesn't reference any presidential candidate or the presidential election specifically.
