</conclusion>

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It primarily targets parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
2. Does not advise voters at polling stations
3. While it mentions Ciolacu, it does so in context of his current government role, not specifically his presidential candidacy
