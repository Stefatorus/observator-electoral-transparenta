Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present (CMF 11240002) - This indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to Candidate:
- Mentions Daniel Constantin, a parliamentary candidate for PNL
- Does not mention any presidential candidates

3. Addresses Wide Population:
- Yes, targets the entire Teleorman county population
- Paid advertisement with significant reach (5,000-6,000 impressions)
- Published on a public platform (Facebook)

4. Electoral Objective:
- Clear electoral message: "județul Teleorman are șansa unui viitor bun daca oamenii vor vota PNL"
- Direct call to vote for PNL
- Links candidate's experience as former Agriculture Minister to local issues

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Contains direct appeal for votes
- Promotes specific party (PNL)

6. Personal Opinion:
- Not a personal opinion but a structured campaign message
- Contains CMF number
- Paid promotional content

However, this appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's legal as it:
1. Targets parliamentary elections only
2. Does not mention presidential candidates
3. Is within the allowed campaign period for parliamentary elections
