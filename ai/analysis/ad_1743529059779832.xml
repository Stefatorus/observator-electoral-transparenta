<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in the post.

2. Refers to candidates: Yes, explicitly mentions two presidential candidates - George Simion and Elena Lasconi.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes. While presenting itself as news coverage of public commentary, the content appears to be crafted to influence voters by portraying one candidate (Simion) positively and another (Lasconi) negatively.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be reporting on public commentary, it selectively presents opinions that favor one candidate, going beyond objective journalism.

6. Personal opinion: This is not presented as a personal opinion but rather as a report of public sentiment, though seemingly curated to favor one candidate.

The post was active during the electoral silence period (November 23), which is prohibited by law. The content clearly aims to influence voter perception by contrasting the candidates' debate performances.

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It explicitly names presidential candidates
- It makes comparative judgments about their behavior
- It's being actively promoted during the electoral silence period
- It reaches a wide audience through paid promotion
- It presents a clear bias favoring one candidate over another
