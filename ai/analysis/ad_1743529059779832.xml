Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidates: Yes, it directly mentions two presidential candidates: George-Nicolae Simion and Elena-Valerica Lasconi.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of 15,000-19,999 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Yes. By portraying one candidate (Simion) as more "gentleman" and implying the other (Lasconi) resorts to insults, it's attempting to influence voters' perceptions during the presidential campaign.

5. Journalism: While it claims to report on public comments, the selective nature and editorial angle suggest this isn't objective journalism but rather opinion-shaping content.

6. Personal opinion: This goes beyond personal opinion as it's a paid advertisement specifically promoting a particular narrative about two presidential candidates.

This post appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It directly references presidential candidates
- It makes comparative judgments between candidates
- It's being promoted after the end of the official campaign period
- It's a paid advertisement reaching a large audience
- It aims to influence public opinion about candidates
