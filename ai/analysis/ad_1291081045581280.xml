Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, includes "CMF 11240015"
2. Refers to candidate: No direct reference to presidential candidates, only mentions USR as a party
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting Neamț county residents
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Pe 1 decembrie, votați USR, poziția 1 pe buletinul de vot!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an organized campaign message

Key observations:

- Does not mention or influence presidential elections
- Contains proper campaign marking (CMF number)
- Large reach (35,000-39,999 impressions)
