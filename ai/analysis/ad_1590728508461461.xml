Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: YES (CMF11240017 present at the end)
2. Refers to candidate: No direct reference to any presidential candidate. However, it promotes PSD's achievements and future promises.
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement reaching 50,000-60,000 impressions
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly promotional content
6. Personal opinion: No, this is official party communication with CMF

The post focuses on:
- PSD's track record in increasing pensions
- Criticism of PNL's actions
- Future promises for pension increases
- Contains statistical data and comparisons
- Uses campaign messaging ("PSD este garan»õia...")

This appears to be legitimate parliamentary election campaign material, as:
1. It focuses on party achievements and promises
2. Doesn't mention presidential candidates
3. Has proper CMF marking
4. Is within the allowed parliamentary campaign period

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is electoral propaganda, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The content focuses on party achievements and future promises regarding pension policies. It contains:
- Party promotion (PSD)
- Critical comparison with opposition (PNL)
- Future electoral promises
- Statistical data to support claims
However, it stays within legal bounds as it's part of the ongoing parliamentary campaign.
