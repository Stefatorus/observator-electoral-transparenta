Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF11240017" is present at the end of the post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not directly refer to any presidential candidate from our list. It discusses PSD as a party and their achievements regarding pensions.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement targeting a large audience (50,000-59,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: While this post has political content, it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections and party achievements rather than the presidential election. It discusses PSD's track record with pension increases and future promises, which is typical for parliamentary campaign messaging.

5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content - it's clearly partisan communication promoting PSD's achievements.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion piece but rather an official party communication with campaign promises and achievements.

Key observations:
- The post focuses on pension increases and PSD's role in government
- It contains specific policy achievements and future promises
- It's critical of PNL but in the context of pension policy
- The content appears to be part of the parliamentary election campaign, which is still ongoing and allowed
- There is no mention of presidential candidates or the presidential election

The presence of a CMF number indicates this is campaign material, but it appears to be for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.
