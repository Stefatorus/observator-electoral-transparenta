Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post doesn't directly name any presidential candidate. However, it mentions PSD as a party.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people) in Suceava.

4. Electoral objective: While the message is negative towards PSD, it appears to be more focused on local/parliamentary politics rather than the presidential election specifically.

5. Journalism: This is clearly not journalism but rather a political message.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official party communication from PNL Suceava, not a personal opinion.

The timing and context are important here. While this is clearly a political message, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period, rather than the presidential election whose campaign period has ended.
