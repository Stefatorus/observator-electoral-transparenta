Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, refers to "Vlad Popa" as candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează PSD", "Votează Vlad Popa Deputat")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This appears to be a parliamentary election advertisement, which is currently allowed as the parliamentary campaign period is ongoing. While it does contain electoral propaganda elements, it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections (for Deputy position) and not the presidential elections.

The post includes:
- A clear call to vote ("Votează")
- Party identification (PSD)
- Candidate name (Vlad Popa)
- Campaign messaging
- CMF number indicating official campaign material

However, since this is specifically for parliamentary elections and not presidential elections, it does not violate Article 55 t).
