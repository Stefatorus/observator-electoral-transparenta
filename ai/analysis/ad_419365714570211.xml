Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is visible in the post
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, directly refers to "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3)
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: While the content appears trivial (asking about what Ciolacu eats for lunch), it's part of a broader campaign to humanize the candidate during electoral period
5. Journalism: This is not journalistic content as it doesn't inform or educate about substantial matters
6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a sponsored campaign message

The post is particularly concerning because:
- It's a paid advertisement
- It directly names a presidential candidate
- It's running after the end of the presidential campaign period
- It's reaching a significant audience (100,001-500,000 estimated audience)
- It's being promoted by PSD Dolj, showing organized party involvement
</analysis>

<conclusion>

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It's a paid political advertisement
- Directly references a presidential candidate
- Is being distributed after the campaign period ended
- Has significant reach and spending behind it
- Is sponsored by a political party organization
