Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post mentions Marcel Ciolacu (presidential candidate) and Alexandru Rafila (PSD minister).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: While the post discusses a healthcare infrastructure project, it ends with a direct thank you to Marcel Ciolacu's government, appearing to promote his leadership and achievements. However, this could also be interpreted as normal governmental communication.

5. Journalism: The post has elements of informative communication about a public infrastructure project, presenting specific details about the hospital construction.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post but rather an institutional communication about a public project.

The timing of this post (November 21, 2024) and its continuation through the electoral silence period is problematic, as it promotes a presidential candidate (Marcel Ciolacu) after the campaign period has ended.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post presents a borderline case of electoral propaganda. While it contains legitimate information about a public infrastructure project, the specific mention and praise of Marcel Ciolacu, a presidential candidate, during the electoral silence period makes it problematic. The post goes beyond simple factual reporting by explicitly thanking and promoting Ciolacu's leadership.
