Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it explicitly mentions two presidential candidates:
- GEORGE-NICOLAE SIMION
- CRISTIAN-VASILE TERHEȘ

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, very clear electoral objective:
- The link title explicitly states "De ce și eu voi vota pentru GEORGE SIMION"
- It's clearly intended to influence voters by promoting one candidate (Simion) while potentially discrediting another (Terheș)

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't follow journalistic standards. It's explicitly promotional content advocating for voting for a specific candidate.

6. Personal opinion: While presented as a personal choice ("eu voi vota"), it's being promoted through paid advertising to influence others, making it propaganda rather than mere personal expression.

The timing is particularly problematic as this advertisement was created on November 22 and has no end date, meaning it continued running during the electoral silence period.
