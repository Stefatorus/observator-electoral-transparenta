Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "CIUCĂ NICOLAE-IONEL" multiple times and identifies him as the PNL presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with an estimated reach of 2,000-2,999 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Clearly yes. The post:
- Explicitly asks for votes for Ciucă
- Lists reasons why to vote for him
- Provides specific voting instructions for November 24
- Makes comparisons with other candidates (indirectly)

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: While it starts as a personal message from a local councillor, it transforms into clear campaign material with direct voting instructions.

This post clearly constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It directly promotes a presidential candidate
- Contains explicit voting instructions
- Makes campaign promises and comparisons
- Is meant to influence voting behavior
- Is a paid advertisement reaching thousands
