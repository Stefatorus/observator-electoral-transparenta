Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (#3 on the list).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post with significant reach (1000-1999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: This is a nuanced case. While it mentions Ciolacu, it primarily discusses his current role as Prime Minister and a specific diplomatic achievement regarding Schengen. The message focuses on his current governmental activity rather than his presidential candidacy.

5. Journalism: While not strictly journalistic, it reports on a specific diplomatic achievement.

6. Personal opinion: Contains celebratory elements but primarily focuses on factual developments regarding Schengen negotiations.

Key considerations:
- The post focuses on Ciolacu's current role as Prime Minister
- The achievement discussed (Schengen negotiations) is a legitimate government activity
- The hashtag #guvernarepsd suggests this is about current governance
- No direct reference to presidential elections or campaign

While this post does mention a presidential candidate (Marcel Ciolacu), its primary focus is on his current role as Prime Minister and a specific diplomatic achievement. The content appears to be communicating government activity rather than campaign messaging. The hashtags and context suggest this is about current governance rather than the presidential campaign. The post doesn't explicitly encourage voting behavior or make campaign promises.

I determine this post does NOT violate Article 55 t) because:
1. It primarily discusses current governmental activities
2. The content focuses on actual diplomatic achievements rather than campaign promises
3. There's no direct call to vote or campaign messaging
4. The context suggests legitimate government communication rather than electoral propaganda
