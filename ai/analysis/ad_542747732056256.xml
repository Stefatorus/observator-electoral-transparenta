<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: "CMF:11240017" - This indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- No direct mention of a presidential candidate
- However, "CALEA SIGURĂ PENTRU #VALEAMARE" appears to be a localized political message

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- It's a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targets between 1,001-5,000 people
- Clearly meant for public consumption

4. Electoral Objective:
- Uses campaign slogan format ("CALEA SIGURĂ")
- Has a CMF number
- However, it appears to be focused on a local area (Valea Mare) rather than presidential elections

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content
- The presence of CMF number confirms its campaign nature

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication from PSD Dâmbovița

While this is clearly electoral propaganda (evidenced by the CMF number and campaign-style messaging), it appears to be focused on local elections or local issues in Valea Mare rather than the presidential election. The message doesn't reference any presidential candidate or the presidential race. Given that parliamentary and local campaigns may still be ongoing, and there's no clear connection to the presidential election, this doesn't appear to violate Article 55 t).
