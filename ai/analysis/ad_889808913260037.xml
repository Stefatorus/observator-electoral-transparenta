Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not specifically mention any presidential candidates. It focuses on local projects for Grecești supported by PSD parliamentarians.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad targeting the population of Grecești.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Grecești!"). The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message listing promises and projects.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj.

Key considerations:
- The post focuses exclusively on parliamentary elections and local development
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential elections
- The call to vote on December 1st relates to parliamentary elections
- Content is focused on local infrastructure projects
