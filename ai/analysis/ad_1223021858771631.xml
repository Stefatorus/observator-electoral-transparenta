<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be primarily focused on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as Prime Minister regarding the Schengen achievement, not specifically promoting his presidential candidacy. The post is signed by a Senate candidate and includes his CMF number, indicating it's properly registered parliamentary campaign material.
