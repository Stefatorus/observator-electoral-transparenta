Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF: 11240015" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Direct reference to candidate: While it doesn't directly name a presidential candidate, it refers to a "professor from the countryside" and is clearly a campaign message for parliamentary elections.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, specifically targets farmers ("Dragi agricultori din Buzău") and has a significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("vă susține în Parlament"), not presidential elections.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message with a CMF number.

Key considerations:
- The post is specifically about parliamentary representation
- There's no mention of presidential elections or candidates
- The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed
- The message is targeted at a specific demographic (farmers) for parliamentary representation

3. Has proper CMF identification
4. Makes no reference to presidential candidates or the presidential race
