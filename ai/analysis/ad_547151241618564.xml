<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- The post includes "CMF: 11240017" which is a clear indicator of electoral propaganda

2. Reference to Candidates:
- The post mentions "#PUCIOASA" but does not directly name any presidential candidate
- However, it uses "CALEA SIGURĂ" which could be seen as a campaign slogan

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targets an estimated audience of 10,001-50,000 people
- Has already reached 5,000-5,999 impressions
- Clearly intended for mass communication

4. Electoral Objective:
- The phrase "CALEA SIGURĂ" (The Sure Way) implies a direction or choice
- However, it appears to be focused on local matters (Pucioasa is a city in Dâmbovița county)
- Could be related to parliamentary elections which are still in the legal campaign period

5. Journalistic Value:
- This is clearly not journalistic content
- It's a promotional message from PSD Dâmbovița

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication

While this post contains elements of electoral propaganda (CMF number, campaign-style messaging), it appears to be focused on local/parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election. The message is vague and doesn't specifically reference any presidential candidate or the presidential race. Since parliamentary election campaigning is still allowed, and this appears to be focused on local/parliamentary matters, it doesn't constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
