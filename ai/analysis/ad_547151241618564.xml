Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF: 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: No direct reference to a presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (5000-5999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, using phrases like "CALEA SIGURĂ" (The Sure Way) with hashtag #PUCIOASA suggests electoral messaging
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly promotional content
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dâmbovița

Additional observations:
- The ad is running without a set end date ("ad_delivery_stop_time: None")

- It's being promoted across multiple platforms (Facebook and Instagram)
- The spending range indicates this is a modest but targeted campaign

<post_id>547151241618564</post_id>
<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This appears to be electoral propaganda because:
1. Contains a CMF number
2. Is a paid promotion
3. Uses campaign-specific language ("CALEA SIGURĂ")
4. Is published by an official party channel (PSD Dâmbovița)

However, this seems to be focused on local/parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections, as it:
1. Makes no mention of presidential candidates
2. Focuses on a specific locality (Pucioasa)
3. Uses local party channels
