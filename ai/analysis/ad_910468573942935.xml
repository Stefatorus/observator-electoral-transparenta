Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF 11240017"
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, refers to Alexandra Crivineanu
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (70,000-79,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly calls for votes ("voteazÄƒ")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

However, this appears to be parliamentary election propaganda, not presidential election propaganda. The post specifically mentions:
- "Alexandra Crivineanu Deputat" (Parliamentary candidate)
- The date mentioned (December 1) is for the parliamentary elections
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential elections

This is important because while the presidential election propaganda period has ended, the parliamentary election propaganda period is still ongoing and allowed.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is indeed electoral propaganda, but it's for the parliamentary elections, not presidential elections. The post explicitly promotes Alexandra Crivineanu for deputy position and mentions December 1st, which is the parliamentary election date. Since parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
