This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that it's specifically for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. The post promotes a Senate candidate and the PSD party list for Parliament, which is perfectly legal at this time.

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it relates exclusively to parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The content makes no reference to presidential candidates or the presidential election, and therefore does not constitute illegal post-campaign presidential election propaganda.
