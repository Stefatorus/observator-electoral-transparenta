<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly mentions "George Simion" who is one of the presidential candidates (Position 2 - Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with a significant reach (80,000-89,999 impressions) and large estimated audience size (>1 million).

4. Electoral objective: The title "George Simion explică cum se cucerește un popor" (George Simion explains how to conquer a people) appears to be politically charged content featuring a presidential candidate. While the full content isn't visible, the title alone suggests political messaging that could influence voters' perceptions.

5. Journalism: This doesn't appear to be journalistic content. The format and title suggest it's more of a political message or statement rather than news reporting.

6. Personal opinion: This is not presented as a personal opinion but rather as a platform for a presidential candidate to present their views.

The timing of this ad (created on November 22, 2024, with no end date) means it would continue running during the electoral silence period and election day, which is prohibited for presidential election-related content.
