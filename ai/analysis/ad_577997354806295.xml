Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, clearly marked as "CMF: 11240015"

2. Refers to candidates:
- Mentions "Ciolacu" (PSD presidential candidate)
- Mentions "Ciucă" (PNL presidential candidate)
- General reference to USR

3. Addresses wide population:
- Yes, it's a paid advertisement with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions)
- Uses inclusive language "fiecare român"
- Direct call to action "Vino la vot!"

4. Electoral objective:
- Clear electoral message promoting USR
- Criticizes current government leadership (Ciolacu and Ciucă)
- Presents USR's promise about tax reduction
- Contains explicit electoral slogan "#USRlaGuvernare"

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Contains party promises and criticism of opponents
- Uses campaign messaging and CMF number
- Paid advertisement

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication (has CMF number and is paid advertising)

The post clearly constitutes electoral propaganda as it meets all criteria under Article 36(7) and carries a CMF number. However, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in the allowed campaign period, rather than specifically advocating for presidential candidates.
