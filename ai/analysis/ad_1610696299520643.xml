Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF: 11240017" is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes - mentions both Nicolae Ciucă (PNL presidential candidate) and Marcel Ciolacu (PSD presidential candidate) directly.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram with an estimated reach of 20,000-25,000 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: Yes - the post clearly aims to influence voters by:
- Criticizing Nicolae Ciucă's promises and leadership
- Praising Marcel Ciolacu's achievements
- Ending with a clear campaign message about PSD's governance

5. Journalism: No - this is clearly partisan content, not journalistic material, as it presents a one-sided view promoting PSD while criticizing PNL.

6. Personal opinion: No - this is a structured, paid political advertisement with a CMF number, not a personal opinion piece.
