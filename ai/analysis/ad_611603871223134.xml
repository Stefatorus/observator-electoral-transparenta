While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it's important to note that it's focused on the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, 2024, not the presidential elections. The content discusses USR's healthcare policy proposals and governance plans, which is allowed as the parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing. There are no references to presidential candidates or the presidential election.
