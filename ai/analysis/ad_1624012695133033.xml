Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't determinative.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, explicitly mentions "Călin Georgescu" who is a presidential candidate (position 11 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of 500,001-1,000,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post explicitly states "Sustin Calin Georgescu!" and makes claims about his polling numbers, clearly attempting to influence voters' opinions.

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's a clear endorsement without any journalistic value or analysis.

6. Personal opinion: While it appears as a personal endorsement, the fact that it's a paid advertisement targeting a large audience transforms it from mere personal opinion to electoral propaganda.

The post contains direct support for a presidential candidate during a period when presidential election propaganda is prohibited. The message is clearly meant to influence voters by:
- Directly endorsing Călin Georgescu
- Suggesting growing popularity ("a crescut in sondaje")
- Creating a narrative of establishment opposition to generate sympathy

<post_id>1624012695133033</post_id>
<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It directly endorses a presidential candidate
- It's a paid advertisement reaching a large audience
- It attempts to influence voter opinion through both direct support and narrative building
- It's running after the end of the legal campaign period
