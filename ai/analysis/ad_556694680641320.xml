This is indeed electoral propaganda, but it's specifically targeted at the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The content focuses on USR's healthcare policy platform for governance, using specific policy proposals and party branding. Since the parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed, this type of propaganda is legal.
