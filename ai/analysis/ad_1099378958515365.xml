<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Presence:
- Yes, contains "CMF: 11240017" which indicates it's electoral propaganda
- However, this is for parliamentary elections, not presidential

2. Candidate Reference:
- Refers to Liviu-Bogdan Ciucă
- He is a candidate for Chamber of Deputies, not for presidential elections
- Not mentioned in the presidential candidates list

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- Clearly addresses wide population
- Paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Large estimated audience (100,001-500,000)

4. Electoral Objective:
- Yes, but for parliamentary elections
- Contains explicit call to vote ("Votează Liviu-Bogdan Ciucă pentru Camera Deputaţilor!")
- Focuses on his platform against drugs

5. Additional Considerations:
- Post is clearly marked as being commanded by PSD Galați
- Contains proper electoral markings and disclaimers
- Targets specifically parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period
