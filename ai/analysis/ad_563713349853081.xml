Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF number: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post does not specifically mention any presidential candidates. It only refers to "parlamentarii PSD" (PSD parliamentarians) and discusses local projects for Amărăștii de Jos.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting the population of Amărăștii de Jos, with an estimated reach of 1,001-5,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The post ends with "Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Amărăștii de Jos!" which is clearly an electoral message, but for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material presenting future projects and calling for votes.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj.

Important context: This advertisement is focused on parliamentary elections (scheduled for December 1st) and local development projects, not the presidential election. The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and therefore allowed.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically targeting the parliamentary elections on December 1st, not the presidential elections. The content focuses on local development projects and PSD parliamentary representatives' promises for Amărăștii de Jos. This type of campaign activity is still legal as it falls within the parliamentary election campaign period.
