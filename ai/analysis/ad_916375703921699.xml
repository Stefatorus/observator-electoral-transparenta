<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly references Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a potentially large audience (estimated 1,000,001+ people).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the content appears to be analyzing Ciolacu's presidential campaign performance, highlighting positive aspects ("campanie structurată, dialog extern consistent").

5. Journalism: While it appears to be a news article, the promotional nature and timing of the paid advertisement during the restricted period suggests it goes beyond pure journalism.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post but rather a promoted news article with electoral implications.

The critical factor here is the timing - this is a paid promotion running after the conclusion of the presidential campaign period, specifically on November 22, 2024, and continuing to run, which directly violates Article 55 t).
