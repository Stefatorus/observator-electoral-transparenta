<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is clearly a political message, it does not constitute presidential electoral propaganda because:
1. It focuses on local policy issues
2. Does not mention any presidential candidates
3. Does not attempt to influence presidential voting
4. Discusses a specific local issue (beach access)
The content appears to be general political communication about local issues, which is allowed during this period.
