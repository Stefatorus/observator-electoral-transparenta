Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Present (CMF 11240017) - This indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Mihai Costel Deputat"
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (25,000-30,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly calls for voting ("voteazÄƒ") on December 1st
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Brasov

However, this appears to be for the parliamentary elections (mentions "Deputat"), not the presidential elections. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed. The post specifically promotes a candidate for deputy position, not for the presidential race.

Key considerations:
- The timing is for December 1st elections (parliamentary)
- The candidate mentioned is running for deputy, not president
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential election

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is LEGAL propaganda because:
1. It targets the parliamentary elections, not presidential
2. The parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing
3. The candidate mentioned is running for deputy
4. No connection to presidential race or candidates
