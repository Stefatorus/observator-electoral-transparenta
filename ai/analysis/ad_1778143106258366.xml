Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, the post directly references Marcel Ciolacu, who is position nr. 3 on the presidential candidates list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to be promoting Marcel Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister regarding Romania's Schengen accession. However, the context and timing (during the electoral period) make it potentially problematic as it builds his image as a successful leader.

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's clearly promotional content highlighting achievements with exclamation marks and celebratory language.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official PSD Dolj post, not a personal opinion.

The post uses hashtags like #MarcelCiolacu and #guvernarePSD, linking the achievement directly to the candidate. While the Schengen achievement is factual, the presentation and timing suggest electoral purposes.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This post presents several elements of electoral propaganda:
- Directly names a presidential candidate
- Promotes his achievements in a celebratory manner
- Uses party-specific hashtags
- Is a paid advertisement with wide reach
- Times with the electoral period
- Aims to build positive image of the candidate

However, it could be argued that this is discussing Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister and the Schengen achievement, which is a significant national event.

PSD Dolj, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin promovarea unui material de propaganda electorala pentru candidatul ION-MARCEL CIOLACU dupa incheierea campaniei electorale. Postarea cu ID-ul 1778143106258366, publicata dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024, promoveaza realizarile candidatului folosind hashtag-uri precum #MarcelCiolacu si #psdscrieistorie, cu scopul clar de a influenta alegatorii prin evidentierea realizarilor acestuia in calitate de prim-ministru, in special aderarea la Schengen. Postarea foloseste un ton laudativ si exclamativ ("O victorie bine meritată pentru români!", "Cu diplomație și ambiție, Marcel Ciolacu îndeplinește un mare vis al românilor!"), depasind simpla informare si constituind propaganda electorala platita, cu un impact estimat intre 100.001 si 500.000 de persoane.
