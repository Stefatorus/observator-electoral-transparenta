<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the required criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF:11240022 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: This post mentions specific candidates:
- Gheorghe Popa (Geo) for Chamber of Deputies
- Alexandru Cibotaru for Senate
However, importantly, these are for parliamentary elections, not presidential.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (40,000-45,000 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections, which is currently allowed. The post explicitly states "Campanie electorală pentru alegerile parlamentare în Bacău!"

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is official campaign communication.

Key considerations:
- The post explicitly states it's for parliamentary elections
- Contains valid CMF number
- Does not mention or reference any presidential candidates
- Uses position number 6, but in context of parliamentary elections
- Campaign period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is indeed electoral propaganda, it is specifically for parliamentary elections, which are currently in their legal campaign period. The post makes no reference to presidential elections or candidates, and therefore does not violate Article 55 t) which specifically addresses presidential election propaganda after the conclusion of that campaign period.
