While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is LEGAL propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period. The post focuses exclusively on parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st and makes no reference to the presidential election or any presidential candidates. The content discusses parliamentary representation and local development projects, which are appropriate topics for parliamentary campaign messaging.
