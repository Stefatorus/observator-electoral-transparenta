While this post contains political elements and mentions a presidential candidate (Marcel Ciolacu), its primary focus is on communicating information about a healthcare infrastructure project. The mention of Ciolacu is incidental and in his capacity as current Prime Minister rather than as a presidential candidate. The post provides specific details about the hospital project and appears more informative than propagandistic.

Pros for propaganda:
- Mentions a presidential candidate
- Paid political advertisement
- Uses party hashtags

Cons for propaganda:
- Focus on factual information about healthcare
- Candidate mentioned in governmental capacity
- No direct electoral appeal

This post does not violate Article 55 t) as it primarily focuses on communicating information about a healthcare infrastructure project rather than engaging in electoral propaganda. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his governmental capacity rather than as a presidential candidate, and the post's main objective appears to be informing about local development rather than influencing electoral choices.
