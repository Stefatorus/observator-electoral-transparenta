<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Present (CMF 11240017) - This indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Sorin Bâscă" as candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (100,000-124,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează PSD", "Votează Sorin Bâscă Deputat")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

However, this appears to be propaganda for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The post specifically promotes:
- PSD as a party for December 1st elections
- Sorin Bâscă as a candidate for Deputy

Since this is focused on the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period, and does not mention or influence the presidential election, this does not violate Article 55 t).
