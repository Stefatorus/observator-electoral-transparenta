This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's for the parliamentary elections (promoting a Deputy candidate) which is still in its legal campaign period. While it contains all elements of electoral propaganda (CMF number, direct calls to vote, paid distribution, clear candidate identification), it does not violate Article 55 t) as it's not related to the presidential elections whose campaign period has ended.
