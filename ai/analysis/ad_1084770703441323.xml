Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF: 11240015" is present at the end of the post, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Refers to candidate: No direct reference to a presidential candidate. The post mentions "Uniunea Salvați România (USR)" but doesn't specifically name Elena Lasconi or any other presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting a large audience (estimated 100,001-500,000 people), specifically addressing women's rights and family policies.

4. Electoral objective: Yes - While this appears to be a policy platform presentation, it's clearly meant to promote USR's agenda and influence voters. The presence of a CMF number confirms its electoral nature.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a promotional message for a political party's platform, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication with a CMF number, presenting policy proposals.

The post discusses policy proposals regarding women's rights, healthcare, and family support. While it promotes USR's platform, it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections rather than the presidential campaign, as it doesn't mention any presidential candidate specifically.
