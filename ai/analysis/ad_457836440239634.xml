1. Has CMF - No visible CMF number in the post.

2. Refers to candidate - Yes, mentions George Simion explicitly, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2).

3. Addresses wide population - Yes, this is a paid Facebook post with significant reach (20,000-24,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective - Yes, the post appears to promote both AUR and George Simion's achievements, specifically highlighting their attempts to improve healthcare and create a mobile hospital.

5. Journalism - No, this is not journalistic content as it's clearly promotional and doesn't follow journalistic standards of objectivity.

6. Personal opinion - No, this is a structured promotional message paid for by a media company (UNIWORLD - MEDIA SRL).

The post specifically promotes George Simion's actions and AUR's initiatives in healthcare, presenting them in a positive light during the presidential campaign period. While healthcare is a legitimate policy issue, the way it's presented here appears to be campaign material promoting a presidential candidate.

UNIWORLD - MEDIA SRL, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unui material de propaganda electorala dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie, respectiv dupa ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Materialul, cu ID-ul 457836440239634 pe Facebook, promoveaza explicit candidatul prezidential George Simion si partidul AUR, prezentand realizarile acestora in domeniul sanatatii, inclusiv crearea unui spital mobil, cu scopul clar de a influenta preferintele electorale ale votantilor. Mesajul are caracter electoral evident, fiind o reclama platita care ajunge la un public larg (20.000-24.999 impresii), depasind sfera unei simple informari si constituind propaganda electorala prin promovarea realizarilor si initiativelor candidatului in perioada post-campanie.
