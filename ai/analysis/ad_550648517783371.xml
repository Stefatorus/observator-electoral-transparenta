Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF (CMF 11240017): Yes, this clearly indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu specifically
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid Facebook post targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Vota»õi #PSD pe 1 decembrie")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material promoting PSD and their achievements
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

The post contains several elements that make it electoral propaganda:
- Has an official CMF number
- Makes electoral promises about infrastructure
- Directly asks for votes
- Promotes PSD's achievements and Marcel Ciolacu's leadership
- Is a paid advertisement reaching a large audience
- Contains party hashtags (#PSD)

However, this appears to be targeting the parliamentary elections on December 1st, NOT the presidential elections. The mention of Marcel Ciolacu is in his capacity as current Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's LEGAL propaganda as it targets the parliamentary elections which are still in their campaign period. While it mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in his capacity as Prime Minister, not as presidential candidate. The focus is on PSD's parliamentary campaign and their infrastructure promises.
