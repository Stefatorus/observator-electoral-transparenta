<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240002 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate/party: Yes, refers to PSD negatively and PNL (and its representatives) positively
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook post targeting 100,001-500,000 people
4. Electoral objective: Yes, it aims to influence voting by:
   - Criticizing PSD's impact on Teleorman
   - Promoting PNL's actions (bringing ministers to Alexandria)
   - Creating a contrast between PSD's alleged negative impact and PNL's positive actions
5. Journalism: No, this exceeds journalistic standards by including clear partisan messaging
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an orchestrated political message with clear electoral intent

However, this appears to be focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential elections, which makes it permissible under the current context where parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed.

The post discusses local politics and parliamentary party activities rather than presidential candidates. Neither CiucÄƒ nor Ciolacu are mentioned in their capacity as presidential candidates.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda (has CMF, partisan messaging, paid distribution), it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections. The content discusses local politics and party activities without referencing the presidential race.
