Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present, but this isn't definitive.

2. Candidate Reference:
- Mentions "Planul Simion" (George-Nicolae Simion, presidential candidate)
- Also mentions "Sergiu Mihalcea" as Senate candidate

3. Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram
- Targets a wide audience in Ilfov
- Has reached between 1,000-1,999 people

4. Electoral Objective:
- Contains a direct call to vote ("VoteazÄƒ Sergiu Mihalcea")
- However, this is specifically for the Senate position, not the presidential election
- The mention of "Planul Simion" is presented as a party policy, not specifically as presidential campaign material

5. Journalism/Personal Opinion:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Presents a political platform regarding energy independence

The post appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections (Senate candidate Sergiu Mihalcea) which are still in their legal campaign period. While it mentions Simion, it does so in the context of party policy rather than his presidential candidacy.

The main call to action is to vote for the Senate candidate, not for the presidential election.
