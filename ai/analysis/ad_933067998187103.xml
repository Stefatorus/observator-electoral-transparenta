Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240022" at the end, indicating it's electoral propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference:
- Mentions Ionel Dancă as deputy candidate
- Mentions Andrei Carabela as senator candidate
- References Ludovic Orban (who is a presidential candidate)

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- It's a paid advertisement reaching 10,000-14,999 impressions
- Targets a broad audience (100,001-500,000 estimated reach)
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram

4. Electoral Objective:
- Clear call to action: "Alegeți #OameniDeÎncredere"
- Promotes specific candidates for parliamentary elections
- Makes campaign promises about tax policies

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is clearly campaign material, not journalism
- Contains specific political promises and calls to vote

6. Personal Opinion:
- While it includes personal experience, it's structured as campaign messaging
- Contains formal political promises and party positions

This appears to be legitimate parliamentary campaign advertising, which is still allowed. While it mentions Ludovic Orban, it's in a historical context referring to his past government leadership, not promoting him as a presidential candidate.

This is electoral propaganda, but it's primarily focused on parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Ludovic Orban is incidental and historical, not promotional for his presidential campaign.
