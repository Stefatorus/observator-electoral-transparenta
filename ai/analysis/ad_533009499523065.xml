Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240015 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: The post doesn't directly name any presidential candidate, but it promotes USR's platform and policies. While Elena Lasconi is USR's presidential candidate, she is not directly mentioned.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement targeting a large audience (100,001-500,000 people), specifically addressing women and families in Romania.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this appears to be electoral propaganda because:
- It presents USR's political platform
- Uses "we will" (vom) promises typical of campaign messaging
- Has a CMF number
- Is a paid political advertisement
- Presents specific policy proposals

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party position with specific policy proposals.

However, this appears to be targeting the parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election, as it focuses on party policies and legislative measures rather than presidential powers or candidates.
