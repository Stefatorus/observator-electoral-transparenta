Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to "Lasconi" who is Elena-Valerica Lasconi, a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people and actual impressions between 6,000-6,999.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message "Lasconi dă dovadă de aroganță" (Lasconi shows arrogance) appears to be an attempt to influence public opinion negatively against the candidate during the election period.

5. Journalism: No, this doesn't appear to be journalistic content. It's a short statement without any context, facts, or reporting elements.

6. Personal opinion: While it could be argued this is an opinion, the fact that it's a paid advertisement with significant reach suggests this is an organized attempt to influence voters rather than merely expressing a personal view.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This appears to be electoral propaganda for several reasons:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- It's a paid advertisement with significant reach
- The message is clearly negative and appears intended to influence voters
- It lacks journalistic merit or educational value
- The timing (November 23, 2024) is after the campaign period has ended
