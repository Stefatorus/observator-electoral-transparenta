Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (#3 on the list). However, he is mentioned in his capacity as head of government, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching between 15,000-19,999 impressions.

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to be primarily informative about a healthcare infrastructure project. While it does praise Marcel Ciolacu and Alexandru Rafila, it does so in their governmental capacities (Prime Minister and Health Minister respectively), not in an electoral context.

5. Journalism: The content is presented as an informative announcement about a public infrastructure project.

6. Personal opinion: This is an institutional communication about a public project, not a personal opinion.

The post focuses on a legitimate government activity (hospital construction) and mentions officials in their current governmental roles rather than as candidates. The primary purpose appears to be informing about a public health infrastructure project rather than electoral propaganda.
