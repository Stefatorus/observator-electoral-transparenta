Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, "CMF: 11240002" is present
2. Refers to candidate: No, this post doesn't mention any presidential candidate
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid advertisement targeting Pârgărești residents
4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("votează PNL pentru viitorul localității noastre!")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

Key observations:
- This is clearly electoral propaganda, but for the parliamentary elections on December 1st
- The post specifically mentions "Pe 1 Decembrie" (December 1st)
- The message is focused on parliamentary representation and local development
- No mention of presidential candidates or presidential elections
- The propaganda is within the legal timeframe for parliamentary elections

This appears to be a legitimate parliamentary election campaign advertisement, which is still allowed during this period. The presidential election propaganda restrictions don't apply here as this is clearly focused on a different election.
