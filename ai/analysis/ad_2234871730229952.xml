<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF:11240015 is present at the end of the post

2. Refers to candidate: The post presents a detailed political program but doesn't explicitly name any presidential candidate from the official list.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement reaching 70,000-80,000 impressions, targeting multiple demographic groups (contributors, citizens, parents, patients, disabled persons, diaspora, youth, elderly, women).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this appears to be a campaign platform presentation, but it's important to note that it seems to be focused on parliamentary/governmental policies rather than specifically presidential elections.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political platform presentation, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured political program presentation.

The post appears to be promoting USR's parliamentary platform (as indicated by the hashtags and the CMF number) rather than specifically addressing the presidential election. While it is electoral propaganda, it falls under the allowed category as it's targeting the parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it appears to be focused on parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections. The content presents a comprehensive government program touching multiple aspects of society and policy areas. The presence of a CMF number confirms its status as official campaign material, but its focus on parliamentary/governmental policies makes it permissible under current campaign rules.
