Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: YES (CMF 11240017) - This confirms it's official electoral propaganda
2. Candidate Reference: Mentions "Marian Rasaliu" as candidate for Deputy position
3. Wide Population Targeting:
   - Paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
   - Large impression range (80,000-90,000)
   - Significant spend (1,500-2,000 RON)
   - Estimated audience size: 100,001-500,000
4. Electoral Objective: Clear call to vote ("Votează PSD", "Votează Marian Rasaliu Deputat")
5. Journalism: No journalistic content, pure campaign message
6. Personal Opinion: No, this is an official party communication

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but importantly, it's for the parliamentary elections which are still in their legal campaign period. The ad promotes a deputy candidate (Marian Rasaliu) and PSD for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential election. Therefore, while this is electoral propaganda, it does not violate Article 55 t) as it's not related to the presidential elections where the campaign period has ended.

- Direct call to vote for specific candidate
- Paid advertisement with wide reach
- Clear electoral objective
However, it's legal propaganda for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections.
