Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Presence: Yes, "CMF 11240017" is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Candidate Reference: The post mentions "Marian Rasaliu Deputat" - this appears to be for parliamentary elections, not presidential elections.

3. Platform and Reach: This is a paid Facebook/Instagram advertisement from PSD Brasov, with significant reach (80,000-89,999 impressions) and substantial spending (1,500-1,999 RON).

4. Content Analysis:
- The message explicitly calls for voting ("VoteazÄƒ")
- Targets parliamentary elections for December 1st
- Promotes PSD and their candidate for deputy position
- Does not mention or reference any presidential candidates
- Is clearly electoral in nature, but for a different election

5. Timing: While this is running during the presidential campaign blackout period, it's specifically targeting the parliamentary elections, which have different campaign periods.

The key distinction here is that this advertisement is specifically for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still active and allowed during this time.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is targeting the parliamentary elections (for deputy position) and not the presidential elections. The law in question (Article 55 t) specifically concerns presidential election propaganda after its conclusion. Since this advertisement is for a different election with an active campaign period, it does not constitute a violation.
