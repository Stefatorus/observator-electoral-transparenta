Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it mentions George Simion (presidential candidate) and Catalin Silegeanu (parliamentary candidate) directly.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with a potential reach of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post discusses electoral chances and outcomes, specifically linking the presidential election results of Simion to parliamentary chances for AUR and Silegeanu.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be sharing news content, the presentation and targeting suggest it goes beyond mere journalistic information.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post but rather a strategic electoral analysis with clear political implications.

The post is problematic because it discusses both parliamentary and presidential elections, creating a direct connection between Simion's presidential campaign (which is in the prohibited period) and AUR's parliamentary chances.
