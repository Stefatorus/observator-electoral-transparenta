Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present, but this isn't determinative.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to "Planul Simion" and promotes George Simion's book/plan, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people, specifically in the Timișoara area.

4. Electoral objective: While it mentions "#Senat2024" suggesting it's aimed at parliamentary elections, the promotion of "Planul Simion" and describing him as "un lider hotărât să redea demnitatea românilor" during the presidential campaign period has clear electoral implications.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly promotional content, not journalistic material.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a paid advertisement promoting a political figure and his vision/plan.

The post appears to be a hybrid promotion - while it includes a hashtag for Senate elections, it's promoting George Simion's leadership and vision during a presidential campaign period.

Postarea cu ID-ul 1313713093326681 prezintă "viziunea unui lider hotărât să redea demnitatea românilor" și promovează "Planul Simion", folosind un limbaj promotional care îl descrie pe candidat ca fiind "singurul" cu un plan "concret, bine gândit", având astfel un efect electoral direct prin influențarea alegătorilor în perioada în care propaganda electorală este interzisă prin lege.
