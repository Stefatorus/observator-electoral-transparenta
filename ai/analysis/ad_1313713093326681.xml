While this post contains elements of political propaganda, it appears to be primarily focused on the parliamentary elections (as evidenced by #Senat2024), which are still in the legal campaign period. Although it mentions Simion's plan, it's presented in the context of parliamentary elections rather than presidential candidacy. The post promotes a book/plan rather than directly advocating for presidential voting.
