<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF:11240002 - This indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to Candidate/Party:
- Directly references PSD (negatively)
- Directly references PNL (positively)
- Is from Daniel Constantin, a PNL representative
- However, does not specifically reference any presidential candidates

3. Addresses Wide Population:
- Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram ad
- Targets a large audience (100,001-500,000 people)
- Addresses the people of Teleorman county

4. Electoral Objective:
- Yes, clear electoral messaging
- Criticizes PSD's performance
- Promotes PNL's solutions
- However, appears to be focused on parliamentary elections, not presidential

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This is not journalism
- It's clearly a political message with campaign promises
- Links to an interview but the post itself is campaign material

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an official party communication
- Structured as campaign messaging

The key point here is that while this is clearly electoral propaganda, it appears to be focused on the parliamentary elections, for which the campaign period is still ongoing and allowed. It does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election.
