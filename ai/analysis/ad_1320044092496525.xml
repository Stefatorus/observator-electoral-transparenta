<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our established criteria:

1. CMF Number:
- Present: CMF 11240017
- The presence of a CMF number strongly indicates this is electoral propaganda

2. Candidate Reference:
- No direct reference to a presidential candidate
- The message appears to be about Șotânga, which is a locality
- However, this appears to be part of a broader PSD campaign, given it's posted by PSD Dâmbovița

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Targeting 1,001-5,000 people
- Clearly meant for mass communication

4. Electoral Objective:
- The phrase "CALEA SIGURĂ" (The Safe Way) implies a political message
- While not explicitly presidential, it's still electoral in nature

5. Journalism/Personal Opinion:
- This is clearly not journalism
- This is a paid political advertisement with a CMF number
- Shows clear campaign messaging

However, this appears to be targeting local/parliamentary elections rather than the presidential election, which is still allowed during this period.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda (presence of CMF, paid distribution, campaign messaging), it appears to be focused on local/parliamentary elections (Șotânga locality) rather than the presidential election. Since parliamentary election propaganda is still allowed during this period, this does not constitute a violation of Article 55 t).
