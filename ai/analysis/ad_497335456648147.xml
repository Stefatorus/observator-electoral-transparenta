Senatorul Sorin Cristian Alic, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin continuarea propagandei electorale după încheierea perioadei legale, într-o postare sponsorizată pe Facebook (ID: 497335456648147) distribuită după ora 18:00 pe 23.11.2024. Postarea conține un îndemn explicit de a vota candidatul George Simion, folosește număr CMF (🅒🅜🅕 - ➊➊➋➍⓿⓿➊➍), și are un evident caracter de propagandă electorală prin mesajul "să ieșim masiv la vot și să votam George Simion", reprezentând o încercare directă de a influența comportamentul electoral al cetățenilor în perioada în care propaganda electorală este interzisă prin lege.
