Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF number: Not present in this post, but as it's from a party organization, not directly from a candidate, this isn't necessarily required.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it specifically mentions three presidential candidates by name: Ciolacu, Simion, and Lasconi.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (10,000-14,999 impressions) and a substantial budget (200-299 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message clearly refers to the elections and attempts to frame them in a specific way, mentioning presidential candidates.

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather a campaign message.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication through paid advertising.

The post presents several concerning elements:
- Direct reference to presidential candidates
- Electoral messaging during the propaganda blackout period
- Paid distribution to reach a wide audience
- Clear electoral context and purpose
