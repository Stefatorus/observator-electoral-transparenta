Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Guvernul Ciolacu" and ION-MARCEL CIOLACU is a presidential candidate. However, the reference is made to his current role as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections ("VotÄƒm PSD la alegerile parlamentare, pe 1 Decembrie!"), not presidential elections.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a political campaign message.

Key observations:

- It discusses concrete governmental actions and future promises

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically targeted at the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, which is still in its legal campaign period. The mention of "Guvernul Ciolacu" is in the context of current governmental achievements, not presidential candidacy. The post focuses on pension policies and explicitly calls for votes in the parliamentary election, not the presidential one.
