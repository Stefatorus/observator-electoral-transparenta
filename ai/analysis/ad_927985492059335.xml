1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "Guvernul Ciolacu" and promotes PSD's actions, but in the context of parliamentary elections, not presidential.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but specifically for parliamentary elections ("VotÄƒm PSD la alegerile parlamentare, pe 1 Decembrie!"), not presidential elections.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material promoting PSD's achievements and seeking votes.
