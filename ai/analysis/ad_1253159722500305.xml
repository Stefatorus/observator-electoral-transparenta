<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, contains "CMF 11240002" which indicates this is electoral propaganda material.

2. Candidate Reference: The post does not directly reference any presidential candidates from our list. It discusses Constantin Teodorescu, a local PNL councilor.

3. Wide Population Targeting: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting a potentially large audience (100,001-500,000 people).

4. Electoral Objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections, not presidential. The post explicitly ends with "Pe 1 decembrie, votÄƒm #PNLNeamt" which is a call to vote for PNL in the parliamentary elections.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a promotional message for PNL and their local representative.

6. Personal Opinion: No, this is an official party communication.

Key context: This appears to be parliamentary election propaganda, which is still allowed, as the parliamentary election campaign is ongoing. The post focuses on local/parliamentary matters and does not mention or attempt to influence the presidential election.

While this is clearly electoral propaganda, it is specifically targeting the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, not the presidential elections. The content discusses local council work and parliamentary initiatives, making no reference to presidential candidates or the presidential election. The propaganda is legal as it falls within the ongoing parliamentary election campaign period.

</conclusion>

The post does not violate Article 55 t) as it is legitimate parliamentary election campaign material that does not reference or attempt to influence the presidential election. The presence of a CMF number and the explicit focus on parliamentary elections and local governance indicates this is properly registered campaign material for the appropriate ongoing election campaign.
