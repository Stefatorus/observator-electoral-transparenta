Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes - "CMF 11240017" is present at the end of the post, indicating it's electoral content.

2. Refers to candidate: The post mentions "premierul Marcel Ciolacu" who is also a presidential candidate (Position 3 - ION-MARCEL CIOLACU). However, the reference is made to his current role as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook/Instagram targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: While the post discusses PSD's cultural program and policies, it focuses on current governmental activities and future party plans rather than the presidential election specifically. It appears to be more about party promotion and government policy than presidential campaign propaganda.

5. Journalism: No - This is clearly a political communication, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No - This is an official party communication, evidenced by the CMF number and structured policy presentation.

Important context: While this is clearly political content, it focuses on PSD's general political program and Marcel Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister, not specifically on the presidential campaign. The content discusses cultural policies and government initiatives rather than presidential election matters.

While this post contains political content and mentions Marcel Ciolacu, it primarily focuses on PSD's cultural policies and Ciolacu's role as Prime Minister. The content doesn't appear to be specifically targeting the presidential election or attempting to influence presidential voting behavior. Instead, it presents party policies and governmental initiatives in the cultural sector. The presence of a CMF number indicates it's electoral content, but this appears to be related to general party communication rather than presidential campaign propaganda.
