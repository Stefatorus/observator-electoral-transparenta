<analysis>
Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present in the post, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: YES - The post directly refers to "Elena Lasconi" who is a presidential candidate (Poziția nr. 1 – ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI – Uniunea Salvați România).

3. Addresses wide population: YES - This is a paid advertisement with an estimated reach of over 1 million people (estimated_audience_size: 1000001+), running on both Facebook and Instagram.

4. Electoral objective: YES - The post appears to be making negative claims about Elena Lasconi regarding alleged connections to convicted persons and SRI protégés, which could influence voters' opinions during the election period.

5. Journalism: While the page claims to be journalistic ("Jurnalism de Investigație"), the format and timing of this paid promotion, along with its sensationalist headline using warning emojis (‼️⚠️), suggests this exceeds normal journalistic activity.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion but a structured, paid campaign targeting a specific candidate.

The timing (after November 22, 2024) and the fact that it's still running makes this particularly problematic as it continues during the electoral silence period for presidential elections.

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- Directly targets a presidential candidate
- Uses paid promotion to reach a wide audience
- Times to influence the presidential election
- Uses sensationalist formatting and negative messaging
- Continues during the electoral silence period
