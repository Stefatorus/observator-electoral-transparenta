Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present in this post. However, this alone is not determinative.

2. Reference to Candidates: The post is about a current AUR deputy, Lucian-Florin Pușcașu, promoting his TikTok account. However, it does not explicitly reference any presidential candidates.

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- The ad reached between 30,000-35,000 impressions
- Spent 300-399 RON
- Targeted potential audience of 500,001-1,000,000 people
- Clearly meant for mass communication

4. Electoral Objective:
- The content appears to be more self-promotional than specifically electoral
- It states factual information about his current position
- Links to a social media account
- Does not contain explicit calls to vote or support for presidential candidates

5. Journalism vs Propaganda:
- This appears to be simple self-promotion rather than electoral propaganda
- No direct connection to the presidential election is made
- Functions more as a general political communication

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is more of a professional announcement than a personal opinion
- Serves primarily as a directory-type information

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
While this is a paid political advertisement, it does not constitute electoral propaganda for the presidential elections because:
1. It does not mention any presidential candidates
2. It focuses on existing role rather than campaigning
3. No clear electoral objective for the presidential race
4. Functions more as general political communication
