<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it directly refers to George Simion, who is a presidential candidate (Position 2 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post appears to be making a negative comparison between George Simion and Alexandr Stoianoglo (former Prosecutor General of Moldova, known for controversial actions), which could influence voters' opinions.

5. Journalism: While this appears to be from a news outlet (PS News), the comparison seems more opinion-based and potentially meant to influence rather than inform.

6. Personal opinion: This is presented as a quote from Siegfried Mure»ôan (a politician), but is being promoted as paid content, suggesting an organized effort rather than personal opinion.

The timing of this ad (starting November 22 and continuing to run) places it after the end of the official campaign period for the presidential election, making it potentially problematic.
