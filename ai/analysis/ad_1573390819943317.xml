Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. CMF Number: Yes, present - "CMF: 11240014" - This indicates it's electoral propaganda.

2. Candidate Reference: Yes, directly mentions "George Simion", who is a presidential candidate (Poziția nr. 2).

3. Wide Population Targeting:
- The post is a paid advertisement
- Significant reach (25,000-29,999 impressions)
- Large estimated audience (500,001-1,000,000)
- Published on both Facebook and Instagram
- Substantial spend (400-499 RON)

4. Electoral Objective:
- Clear political messaging
- Uses political party hashtags (#AURÎnParlament)
- Promotes both parliamentary and presidential aspects
- Links economic issues to political solutions
- Uses campaign slogans and party-specific hashtags

5. Journalism vs. Propaganda:
- This is clearly not journalism
- Contains campaign messaging
- Presents partisan political viewpoints
- Makes political promises

6. Personal Opinion:
- This is not a personal opinion but an organized campaign message
- Has professional backing (paid by TOP DUO CONSULTING S.R.L.)
- Uses official campaign formatting and CMF number

This appears to be a dual-purpose advertisement, promoting both parliamentary elections (which is allowed) and presidential candidate George Simion (which is not allowed after the propaganda period).
