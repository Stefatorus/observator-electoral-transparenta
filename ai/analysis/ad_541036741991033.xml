Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: YES - Contains "CMF: 11240002" multiple times
2. Refers to candidate: NO - Does not mention any presidential candidate specifically
3. Addresses wide population: YES - It's a paid advertisement targeting 500,000-1,000,000 people
4. Electoral objective: YES - But for parliamentary elections, not presidential
5. Journalism: NO - Clear campaign message
6. Personal opinion: NO - Official party communication

This is a paid political advertisement by PNL Bacău that explicitly promotes:
- Parliamentary elections ("lupta pentru proiectele importante ale Bacăului în Parlament")
- Calls for voting PNL on December 1st (parliamentary election date)
- Makes no mention of presidential candidates or presidential elections

Important distinction: While this is electoral propaganda, it's specifically for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st, where the campaign period is still active and allowed. It does not reference the presidential election or any presidential candidates.
