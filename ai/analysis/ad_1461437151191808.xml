While this post does mention Marcel Ciolacu, it does so in the context of his current role as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate. The content focuses on government policies and economic measures, without any direct connection to the presidential campaign. The timing and content suggest this is regular government communication rather than electoral propaganda.
