Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral content.

2. References to candidate: Yes, mentions Marcel Ciolacu extensively, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3). However, the post exclusively discusses his actions as Prime Minister, not as a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, it's a paid post on Facebook and Instagram targeting a large audience (estimated 1M+ reach).

4. Electoral objective: The content focuses on Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister regarding Romania's Schengen accession, rather than promoting his presidential candidacy. The context is clearly governmental, not electoral.

5. Journalism: The post presents official government activities and diplomatic meetings in a news-style format.

6. Personal opinion: This is an official communication about governmental activities, not personal opinions.

Key consideration: While this mentions a presidential candidate, it does so exclusively in his capacity as Prime Minister, discussing current governmental affairs (Schengen negotiation). The timing, while during the electoral period, relates to actual diplomatic events and governmental achievements.
