Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF number: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: This post does not directly reference any presidential candidates from our provided list. It focuses on local projects for Băilești municipality and mentions PSD parliamentarians in general.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook advertisement targeting the population of Băilești, with an estimated reach of 10,001-50,000 people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, but for parliamentary elections ("Pe 1 Decembrie, votează calea sigură pentru Băilești!"). This is important because the parliamentary election campaign is still ongoing and allowed.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message listing promises and projects.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication from PSD Dolj.

Important context: This appears to be parliamentary election propaganda, not presidential election propaganda. The date of December 1st mentioned refers to the parliamentary elections, for which campaigning is still permitted.
