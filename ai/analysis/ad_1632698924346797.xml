<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF (CMF 11240017) - Yes, this indicates it's electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate - Yes, mentions "Adriana Adam" as candidate for Deputy
3. Addresses wide population - Yes, it's a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (200,000-250,000 impressions)
4. Electoral objective - Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("Votează PSD", "Votează Adriana Adam Deputat")
5. Journalism - No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion - No, this is an official party communication

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's important to note that this is for the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The ad promotes:
- PSD as a party
- Adriana Adam as a candidate for Deputy

Since this is for the parliamentary elections which are still in the allowed campaign period, this does not violate Article 55 t) of Law 370/2004.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda as it:
- Contains a CMF number
- Directly asks for votes
- Promotes specific candidates and party
- Is a paid advertisement with wide reach
However, as it's for parliamentary elections, it's within the legal campaign period.
