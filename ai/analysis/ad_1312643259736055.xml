Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Ioana Henegar" as a Senate candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (175,000-199,999 impressions) and substantial spend (2500-2999 RON).

4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly calls for votes ("voteazÄƒ") for both PSD and specifically for Ioana Henegar.

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign message, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication with clear electoral intent.

However, this appears to be for the parliamentary elections (Senate position) which is still in its legal campaign period. The mention of "Pe 1 Decembrie" refers to the parliamentary election date, not the presidential election. While this is electoral propaganda, it's legal as it's within the allowed timeframe for parliamentary elections.

The post does not mention or reference any presidential candidates, nor does it attempt to influence the presidential election voting.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's LEGAL propaganda for the parliamentary elections, which are still in their campaign period. The post promotes a Senate candidate and the PSD party for the December 1st parliamentary elections, without any reference to the presidential election.
