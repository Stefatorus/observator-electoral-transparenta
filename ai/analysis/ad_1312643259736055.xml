<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral propaganda
2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Ioana Henegar" for Senator position
3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram ad with significant reach (175,000-199,999 impressions)
4. Electoral objective: Yes, explicitly asks for votes ("votează PSD", "Votează Ioana Henegar Senator")
5. Journalism: No, this is clearly campaign material
6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication

However, this appears to be targeting the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed. This post is promoting a Senate candidate (Ioana Henegar) and the PSD party for the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1st.

This is legitimate electoral propaganda for the ongoing parliamentary campaign, not a violation of Article 55 t) which pertains to presidential election propaganda after its conclusion.

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This is clearly electoral propaganda, but for the parliamentary elections:
- Contains CMF number
- Direct call to vote
- Paid advertisement
- Names specific candidate
- Large reach and spending
However, as it targets the parliamentary elections (December 1st) and not the presidential elections, it is legally compliant.
