<analysis>
Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, CMF 11240017 is present, indicating this is electoral material.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, specifically mentions "președintele Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post with significant reach (15,000-19,999 impressions).

4. Electoral objective: The post appears to have a mixed purpose:
- It primarily discusses parliamentary elections ("echipa PSD pentru Parlamentul României")
- However, it also promotes Marcel Ciolacu as president
- Uses slogans "Calea sigură pentru Maramureș!" and "Calea sigură pentru România!"

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign post, not journalistic content.

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official party communication (PSD Maramureș) with campaign messaging.

Key consideration: While this post does mention Marcel Ciolacu, it primarily focuses on parliamentary elections, which are still in their legal campaign period. The mention of Ciolacu is in context of his role as party leader rather than specifically as presidential candidate.
