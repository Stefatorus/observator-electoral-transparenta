4. Electoral objective: Yes - The post clearly has an electoral objective, criticizing PNL's policies and positions while implicitly promoting PSD's stance on various issues, particularly regarding pensions and taxation.

5. Journalism: No - This is not journalistic content but rather political messaging and criticism of opposing party's positions.
