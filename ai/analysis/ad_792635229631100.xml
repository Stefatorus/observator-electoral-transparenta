Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF11240017" which indicates this is electoral propaganda material

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marcel Ciolacu" who is a presidential candidate (Position 3)

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with significant reach (25,000-29,999 impressions)

4. Electoral objective: Yes, while subtle, it promotes Marcel Ciolacu's government achievements and uses the campaign slogan "#caleasigurapentruromania"

5. Journalism: No, this is clearly a campaign activity report with promotional intent

6. Personal opinion: No, this is a structured campaign message highlighting achievements

The post describes a door-to-door campaign visit, promoting government achievements under Marcel Ciolacu's leadership. While it could be argued this is about his role as Prime Minister, the presence of the CMF number and campaign hashtag clearly positions this as electoral content.

The timing and continued promotion of this content after the end of the presidential campaign period makes this problematic.
