Let's analyze this post according to our criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, contains "CMF: 11240060" which indicates it's electoral propaganda

2. Refers to candidate: Not directly, but refers to "vechii politicieni" (old politicians) and calls for their replacement ("Schimbă-i!")

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement with significant reach (90,000-99,999 impressions)

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the message clearly has an electoral objective:
- Criticizes current administration's priorities
- Uses sarcasm about spending public money on "manele"
- Explicitly calls for change ("Schimbă-i!")

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content. It's a clear campaign message with a call to action.

6. Personal opinion: While presented as criticism, the presence of CMF number and the call to action make this electoral propaganda rather than mere personal expression.

The post is particularly problematic because:
- It's still running after the propaganda period for presidential elections
- Contains a CMF number
- Has a clear electoral message calling for change
- Is a paid advertisement reaching a large audience

<conclusion>
<post_id>1266932291022514</post_id>
<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- Contains official CMF number
- Clear electoral message calling for political change
- Significant paid reach
- Direct criticism of current politicians with call to action
- Not informative or journalistic in nature

Ghergu Nicolae-Marius, pentru incalcarea articolului 55 t) din Legea 370/2004, prin difuzarea unui mesaj de propaganda electorala dupa incheierea perioadei de campanie, folosind o reclama platita pe Facebook (ID: 1266932291022514) care continua sa ruleze dupa data de 23.11.2024, ora 18:00. Postarea contine numar CMF (11240060), are obiectiv electoral explicit prin indemnul "Schimbă-i!" si criticarea administratiei actuale, si atinge un public larg (90.000-99.999 impresii). Mesajul are ca scop influentarea comportamentului electoral prin critica directa a actualilor politicieni si indeamna la schimbarea acestora, depasind sfera unei simple opinii personale prin natura sa de continut sponsorizat si prezenta elementelor specifice propagandei electorale.
