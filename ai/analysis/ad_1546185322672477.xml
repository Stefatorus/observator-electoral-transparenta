3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook/Instagram post targeting 100,001-500,000 people

4. Electoral objective: Yes, while the post appears to be about Romania joining Schengen, it prominently praises Marcel Ciolacu's leadership abilities and PSD's competence. The timing and context suggest this is meant to influence voters by highlighting Ciolacu's achievements as Prime Minister
