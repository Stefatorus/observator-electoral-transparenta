Let me analyze this post against the key criteria:

1. CMF Number: Not present, but this doesn't automatically disqualify it as propaganda.

2. Reference to Candidate: The post directly refers to "Lasconi" (ELENA-VALERICA LASCONI), who is a presidential candidate.

3. Addressing Wide Population: 
- This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram
- Has reached between 35,000-39,999 impressions
- Targeted potential audience of over 1 million people
- Spent between 100-199 RON

4. Electoral Objective:
- The post appears to mock the candidate ("Să ne amuzăm cu Lasconi🤣🤣🤣")
- The timing is crucial - during the electoral silence period
- The intention appears to be to diminish the candidate's image

5. Journalism: This does not qualify as journalism as:
- No informative content
- No educational value
- Purely mockery without substantive content

6. Personal Opinion: This goes beyond personal opinion as it's:
- A paid advertisement
- Targeting a massive audience
- Specifically designed to influence public perception during silence period

<conclusion>

<electoral-propaganda-analysis>
This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- Directly targets a presidential candidate
- Is a paid advertisement reaching a large audience
- Occurs during the electoral silence period
- Attempts to influence public opinion through mockery
- Uses significant financial resources to boost reach
- Is not journalistic or informative in nature
