Let's analyze this post according to the established criteria:

1. Has CMF: No CMF number is present in this post.

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, it refers directly to Marcel Ciolacu, who is a presidential candidate (Position 3 on the ballot).

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram with an estimated reach of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: Yes, the post appears to have an electoral objective. The language "Se știe la cine s-a mutat comanda asupra României dacă nu îi oprim" is a clear call to action against Ciolacu, suggesting electoral consequences.

5. Journalism: While it attempts to present itself as news, the tone and language used ("pupe mâna stăpânului") is clearly editorialized and goes beyond standard journalistic practice.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post but rather a targeted message with clear political implications.

The post uses charged language ("pupe mâna stăpânului") and makes direct accusations about Ciolacu's loyalty to Hungary, with a clear call to action ("dacă nu îi oprim"). While Ciolacu is currently Prime Minister, the context and timing of this advertisement during the presidential election period, combined with the call to action, suggests this is electoral propaganda.
