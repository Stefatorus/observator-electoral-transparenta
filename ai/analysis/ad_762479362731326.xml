Let me analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: No visible CMF number, but this isn't determinative.

2. Refers to candidate: YES - Elena Lasconi is explicitly mentioned, who is a presidential candidate.

3. Addresses wide population: YES - This is a paid advertisement on Facebook and Instagram, targeting a potential audience of over 1 million people.

4. Electoral objective: YES - By highlighting controversial statements about abortion from a presidential candidate during the election period, it appears designed to influence voters' opinions.

5. Journalism: While it appears to be reporting on a statement, the way it's presented and promoted as a paid ad during the election period suggests it goes beyond simple journalistic reporting.

6. Personal opinion: This is not a personal opinion post, but rather a promoted news article about a candidate's statements.

The post is particularly concerning because:
- It's a paid promotion
- It targets a specific presidential candidate
- It's running after the end of the presidential campaign period
- It focuses on a controversial topic (abortion) that could influence voters
- It's reaching a significant audience (5,000-6,000 impressions)

</analysis>

<conclusion>

This constitutes electoral propaganda because:
- It directly targets a presidential candidate
- It's a paid promotion
- It addresses a controversial topic that could influence voters
- It's being distributed after the campaign period ended
- It reaches a wide audience through paid distribution
