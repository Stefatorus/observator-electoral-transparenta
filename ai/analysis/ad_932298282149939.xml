Let's analyze this post according to the given criteria:

1. Has CMF: Yes, there is a CUI mandatar financiar mentioned at the end (11240017)

2. Refers to candidate: Yes, mentions "Marius Negru, candidat PSD Gorj pentru Camera DeputaÅ£ilor"

3. Addresses wide population: Yes, this is a paid Facebook ad targeting a potential audience of 100,001-500,000 people

4. Electoral objective: Yes, this is clearly electoral content as:
- It presents a candidate's platform and promises
- Uses party symbols (ðŸŒ¹ for PSD)
- Ends with a call to action for support
- Contains campaign hashtags (#GorjulConteaza #CaleaSiguraPentruGorj)

5. Journalism: No, this is not journalistic content but rather campaign material

6. Personal opinion: No, this is an official campaign communication from PSD Gorj

However, this post is specifically about the parliamentary elections, not the presidential elections. The propaganda period for parliamentary elections is still ongoing and allowed.

This is clearly electoral propaganda, but it's legal because:
- It targets parliamentary elections, not presidential
- It promotes a parliamentary candidate (Marius Negru for Chamber of Deputies)
- The campaign period for parliamentary elections is still active
- It contains all required legal disclaimers including CUI

</conclusion>

While this is electoral propaganda, it does NOT violate Article 55 t) as it is exclusively focused on parliamentary elections, for which campaigning is still allowed. The content does not mention or influence presidential elections, nor does it attempt to influence voters at polling stations.
