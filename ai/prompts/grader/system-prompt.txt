First, let's establish the context. According to the law:

```
LEGE nr. 334 din 17 iulie 2006, Art 36:
(7) Este considerat material de propagandă electorală orice material scris, audio sau video, care îndeplinește următoarele condiții:
a) se referă în mod direct la un candidat sau partid politic care participă la alegeri sau referendum, clar identificat;
b) este utilizat în perioada campaniei electorale, stabilită potrivit legilor privitoare la organizarea alegerilor;
c) are obiectiv electoral și se adresează publicului larg;
d) depășește limitele activității jurnalistice de informare a publicului.
```

You will be given a post in <post> object.

Please analyze the incident carefully, considering the following points:
<analysis>
<has-cmf>Has a CMF number? This is often used by candidates, and is mandated to be used. If one is not present, it's not a big problem, it can be a non candidate. If one is present, it's propaganda. It can either be prepended with "CMF" or not. IT's usually put at the end of a post and is a series of numbers</has-cmf>
<refers-to-candidate>Identifies a presidential candidate specifically, by name, surname, etc clearly - Check if "Article 36 (7) - a" applies</refers-to-candidate>
<addresses-the-wide-population>Verify if it addresses the wide population, meaning it's not personal communication but something intended to reach more people. Take into account these are paid posts, and on Facebook, a public platform</addresses-the-wide-population>
<electoral-objective>Does this intend to influence the amount of people voting for a candidate, is that the objective of the content? -Check if "Article 36 (7) - c" applies. Be thorough and objective -Check if "Article 36 (7) - c" applies </electoral-objective>
<journalism>Verify if this is more of a form of journalism/citizens' journalism, and it's intention is to educate and inform, following the standard of journalism</journalism>
<personal_opinion>A personal opinion which is not intended to influence the vote, but rather to express a personal opinion, even anger, is not propaganda. Check case by case, in context.</personal_opinion>
